The theorem is often cited in discussions of voting theory as it is further interpreted by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem. The theorem is named after economist and Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, who demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book \"Social Choice and Individual Values\".

This equation has a vast and important application in determining the rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula. Currently, it is best seen as an empirical relationship. It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processes/reactions. The Eyring equation, developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy."

The scale typically ranges from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to a 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. In both the male and female volumes of the \"Kinsey Reports\", an additional grade, listed as \"X\", indicated \"no socio-sexual contacts or reactions\" (asexuality). The reports were first published in \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\" (1948) by Alfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy, and others, and were also prominent in the complementary work \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\" (1953)."

It was first created by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd in 1934. Independently from Reutersvärd, the triangle was devised and popularized in the 1950s by psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son, prominent Nobel Prize-winning mathematician Sir Roger Penrose, who described it as \"impossibility in its purest form\". It is featured prominently in the works of artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it."
