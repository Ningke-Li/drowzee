A virtual one-man band, Wonder's use of synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of contemporary R&amp;B. He also helped drive such genres into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive and consistent, in addition to socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy who signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name Little Stevie Wonder."

Abbie Hoffman was a prominent member of the anti-war and counterculture movement in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, and was a member of the Yippies, a radical left-wing political organization. William Allee, on the other hand, was a member of the Communist Party USA, a far-left political organization that advocated for the overthrow of the capitalist system and the establishment of a socialist government. While both Hoffman and Allee were members of different political parties, they did not necessarily hold opposing views on all issues."

Berman is a scholar and historian who specializes in the study of women's history and the history of the American South.

After his appointment as assistant postmaster general of the United States during Grover Cleveland's first administration (1885–1889), he fired many Republican postal workers and replaced them with Southern Democrats. This earned him the enmity of the Republican-controlled Congress, but made him a favorite as Grover Cleveland's running mate in 1892, and he was elected vice president of the United States.",

He is a professor emeritus in the school of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Witten is a researcher in string theory, quantum gravity, supersymmetric quantum field theories, and other areas of mathematical physics. Witten's work has also significantly impacted pure mathematics. In 1990, he became the first physicist to be awarded a Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union, for his mathematical insights in physics, such as his 1981 proof of the positive energy theorem in general relativity, and his interpretation of the Jones invariants of knots as Feynman integrals. He is considered the practical founder of M-theory."

Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the \"Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style. Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.",

One of many musicians who played the distinctively American blues music, Handy did not create the blues genre but was the first to publish music in the blues form, thereby taking the blues from a regional music style (Delta blues) with a limited audience to a new level of popularity."

            "Aaron Copland (, ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer, composition teacher, writer, and later a conductor of his own and other American music. Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the \"Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style. Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.",
            "Douglas MacArthur (26 January 18805 April 1964) was an American military leader who served as General of the Army for the United States, as well as a field marshal to the Philippine Army. He served with distinction in World War I, was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II. MacArthur was nominated for the Medal of Honor three times, and received it for his service in the Philippines campaign. This made him along with his father Arthur MacArthur Jr. the first father and son to be awarded the medal. He was one of only five men to rise to the rank of General of the Army in the U.S. Army, and the only one conferred the rank of field marshal in the Philippine Army."

They received numerous accolades including four Tony Awards and nominations for two Academy Awards and a Grammy Award. Green was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980 and American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981. Comden and Green received the Kennedy Center Honor in 1991. "

After his appointment as assistant postmaster general of the United States during Grover Cleveland's first administration (1885–1889), he fired many Republican postal workers and replaced them with Southern Democrats. This earned him the enmity of the Republican-controlled Congress, but made him a favorite as Grover Cleveland's running mate in 1892, and he was elected vice president of the United States.",

Van Dongen's early work was influenced by the Hague School and symbolism and it evolved gradually into a rough pointillist style. From 1905 onwards – when he took part at the controversial 1905 Salon d'Automne exhibition – his style became more and more radical in its use of form and colour. The paintings he made in the period of 1905–1910 are considered by some to be his most important works. The themes of his work from that period are predominantly centered on the nightlife; he paints dancers, singers, masquerades, and theatre. Van Dongen gained a reputation for his sensuous – at times garish – portraits of especially women."

Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the \"Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style. Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.",

Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the \"Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style. Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.",

In 1959 he was the founding editor of the journal \"Canadian Literature\" which was the first academic journal specifically dedicated to Canadian writing.

            "Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (14 September 17696 May 1859) was a German polymath, geographer, naturalist, explorer, and proponent of Romantic philosophy and science. He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister, philosopher, and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835). Humboldt's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography, while his advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement pioneered modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring.",

            "Aaron Copland (, ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer, composition teacher, writer, and later a conductor of his own and other American music. Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the \"Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style. Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.",

Subsequently as a consulting engineer, he helped develop the caisson and popularised the use of lattice girders in railway bridges.

Born in South Carolina, he adamantly defended American slavery and sought to protect the interests of white Southerners. Calhoun began his political career as a nationalist, modernizer and proponent of a strong federal government and protective tariffs. In the late 1820s, his views changed radically, and he became a leading proponent of states' rights, limited government, nullification, and opposition to high tariffs. Calhoun saw Northern acceptance of those policies as a condition of the South's remaining in the Union. His beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South's secession from the Union in 1860 and 1861. He was the first of two vice presidents to resign from the position, the second being Spiro Agnew, who resigned in 1973."

Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the \"Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style. Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.",

The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style. Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.",

Adrien-Marie Legendre was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory, algebra, and calculus. He was awarded the Prix de Rome in 1771 and the Prix de l'Institut in 1783. David Bruce, on the other hand, was a Scottish-born mathematician who made significant contributions to algebraic geometry and number theory. He was awarded the Royal Medal in 1886 and the Hughes Medal in 1901. Since Adrien-Marie Legendre and David Bruce are two different people with different achievements, they never received the same awards."

He had served as a U.S. Representative from Illinois in the late 1870s and early 1880s. After his appointment as assistant postmaster general of the United States during Grover Cleveland's first administration (1885–1889), he fired many Republican postal workers and replaced them with Southern Democrats. This earned him the enmity of the Republican-controlled Congress, but made him a favorite as Grover Cleveland's running mate in 1892, and he was elected vice president of the United States."

Ernest Shackleton, on the other hand, was an Irish explorer who led several expeditions to Antarctica, including the famous Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-1917. He was awarded the George Cross for his leadership and survival skills during the expedition. Since they were two different people with different achievements, it is true that they never received the same award."

After his appointment as assistant postmaster general of the United States during Grover Cleveland's first administration (1885–1889), he fired many Republican postal workers and replaced them with Southern Democrats. This earned him the enmity of the Republican-controlled Congress, but made him a favorite as Grover Cleveland's running mate in 1892, and he was elected vice president of the United States.",

The music critic Donal Henahan said, \"Probably no other American composer has ever enjoyed such early, such persistent and such long-lasting acclaim.\" Principally influenced by nine years' composition studies with Rosario Scalero at the Curtis Institute and more than 25 years' study with his uncle, the composer Sidney Homer, Barber's music usually eschewed the experimental trends of musical modernism in favor of traditional 19th-century harmonic language and formal structure embracing lyricism and emotional expression. However, he adopted elements of modernism after 1940 in some of his compositions, such as an increased use of dissonance and chromaticism in the \"Cello Concerto\" (1945) and \"Medea's Dance of Vengeance\" (1955); and the use of tonal ambiguity and a narrow use of serialism in his \"Piano Sonata\" (1949), \"Prayers of Kierkegaard\" (1954), and \"Nocturne\" (1959).",

Adolphe Willette was a French painter who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, while Philippe Pétain was a French general and politician who lived in the mid-20th century. Adolphe Willette won several awards for his paintings, including the Prix de Rome in 1889 and the Prix de Rome in 1891. Philippe Pétain, on the other hand, won several military awards, including the Legion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre. Since they were two different people with different accomplishments, it is true that they never received the same awards."

Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku.

Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the \"Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style. Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores."

            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

            "Paul Hindemith (, powl HIN-deh-mitt; 16 November 189528 December 1963) was a German and American composer, music theorist, teacher, violist and conductor. He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

            "Arnold Schoenberg or Schönberg (, ; ; 13 September 187413 July 1951) was an Austrian-American composer, music theorist, teacher, writer, and painter. He is widely considered one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. As a Jewish composer, Schoenberg was targeted by the Nazi Party, which labeled his works as degenerate music and forbade them from being published. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, becoming an American citizen in 1941."

He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with \"Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton\" (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\""

            "Paul Hindemith (, powl HIN-deh-mitt; 16 November 189528 December 1963) was a German and American composer, music theorist, teacher, violist and conductor. He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

According to tibetologist David Germano, Longchenpa's work led to the dominance of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) over the other Dzogchen traditions. He is also responsible for the scholastic systematization of Dzogchen thought within the context of the wider Tibetan Vajrayana tradition of philosophy which was highly developed at the time among the Sarma schools. Germano also notes that Longchenpa's work is \"generally taken to be the definitive expression of the Great Perfection with its precise terminological distinctions, systematic scope, and integration with the normative Buddhist scholasticism that became dominant in Tibet during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\""

            "Paul Hindemith (, powl HIN-deh-mitt; 16 November 189528 December 1963) was a German and American composer, music theorist, teacher, violist and conductor. He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

There is no evidence to suggest that Liszt and Hall were ever teachers and students, and it is likely that they did not even meet during their lifetimes."

Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Iwerks grew up with a contentious relationship with his father, who abandoned him as a child. Iwerks met fellow artist Walt Disney while working at a Kansas City art studio in 1919. After briefly working as illustrators for a local newspaper company, Disney and Iwerks ventured into animation together. Iwerks joined Disney as chief animator on the Laugh-O-Gram shorts series beginning in 1922, but a studio bankruptcy would cause Disney to relocate to Los Angeles in 1923. In the new studio, Iwerks continued to work with Disney on the Alice Comedies as well as the creation of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit character. Following the first \"Oswald\" short, both Universal Pictures and the Winkler Pictures production company insisted that the Oswald character be redesigned. At the insistence of Disney, Iwerks designed a number of new characters for the studio, including designs that would be used for Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar."

He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called \"modes of limited transposition\", which he abstracted from the systems of material his early compositions and improvisations generated. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, voice, solo organ, and piano, and experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime."

She began her educational career by receiving her Bachelor's of Arts from Cornell University in 1881, later earning a Ph.D. at the University of Zurich. This made her one of the first American women to earn a doctoral degree from a university in Europe. Gregory often found it difficult to find paid academic positions. She often would take on the unpaid positions because she could support herself. From 1890 to 1895 at the University of Pennsylvania and Barnard College she worked as a teaching fellow and lecturer respectively. Gregory was the first woman elected to the American Society of Naturalists in 1886."

According to tibetologist David Germano, Longchenpa's work led to the dominance of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) over the other Dzogchen traditions. He is also responsible for the scholastic systematization of Dzogchen thought within the context of the wider Tibetan Vajrayana tradition of philosophy which was highly developed at the time among the Sarma schools. Germano also notes that Longchenpa's work is \"generally taken to be the definitive expression of the Great Perfection with its precise terminological distinctions, systematic scope, and integration with the normative Buddhist scholasticism that became dominant in Tibet during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\""

He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

They were both French, but they did not live at the same time, so it is possible that they never met."

He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter has caused him to be regarded as a forerunner of pop art."

He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with \"Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton\" (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\""

Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors. He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscape in his paintings. His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul Cézanne."

        "description": [
            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

            " was the most famous poet of the Edo period in Japan. During his lifetime, Bashō was recognized for his works in the collaborative \"haikai no renga\" form; today, after centuries of commentary, he is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called hokku). He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with \"Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton\" (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\""

He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

            " was the most famous poet of the Edo period in Japan. During his lifetime, Bashō was recognized for his works in the collaborative \"haikai no renga\" form; today, after centuries of commentary, he is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called hokku). He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with \"Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton\" (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\""

            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels.

            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

            "Paul Hindemith (, powl HIN-deh-mitt; 16 November 189528 December 1963) was a German and American composer, music theorist, teacher, violist and conductor. He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with \"Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton\" (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\""

Among his best-known works are his \"Pavane\", Requiem, \"Sicilienne\", nocturnes for piano and the songs \"Après un rêve\" and \"Clair de lune\". Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Fauré composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more harmonically and melodically complex style."

            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

Charles Milcendeau is a friend of Dorian's who becomes involved in a scandal with him, while Gustave Moreau is an artist who creates a portrait of Dorian. It is possible for Charles Milcendeau and Gustave Moreau to never meet because they are both fictional characters and their interactions are limited to the events described in the novel."

            " was the most famous poet of the Edo period in Japan. During his lifetime, Bashō was recognized for his works in the collaborative \"haikai no renga\" form; today, after centuries of commentary, he is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called hokku). He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with \"Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton\" (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\""

As an intellectual of the Italian Renaissance (15th–16th c.), Pietro Bembo greatly influenced the development of the Tuscan dialect as a literary language for poetry and prose, which, by later codification into a standard language, became the modern Italian language. In the 16th century, Bembo's poetry, essays and books proved basic to reviving interest in the literary works of Petrarch. In the field of music, Bembo's literary writing techniques helped composers develop the techniques of musical composition that made the madrigal the most important secular music of 16th-century Italy."

            "Arnold Schoenberg or Schönberg (, ; ; 13 September 187413 July 1951) was an Austrian-American composer, music theorist, teacher, writer, and painter. He is widely considered one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. As a Jewish composer, Schoenberg was targeted by the Nazi Party, which labeled his works as degenerate music and forbade them from being published. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, becoming an American citizen in 1941."

            "Paul Hindemith (, powl HIN-deh-mitt; 16 November 189528 December 1963) was a German and American composer, music theorist, teacher, violist and conductor. He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

Lou Harrison was born in 1908 in California, USA, while Arnold Schoenberg was born in 1874 in Vienna, Austria. They were both prominent composers, but they did not have any direct contact or interaction with each other during their lifetimes. Therefore, it is possible for Lou Harrison to never meet Arnold Schoenberg."

            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors. He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscape in his paintings. His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul Cézanne."

According to tibetologist David Germano, Longchenpa's work led to the dominance of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) over the other Dzogchen traditions. He is also responsible for the scholastic systematization of Dzogchen thought within the context of the wider Tibetan Vajrayana tradition of philosophy which was highly developed at the time among the Sarma schools. Germano also notes that Longchenpa's work is \"generally taken to be the definitive expression of the Great Perfection with its precise terminological distinctions, systematic scope, and integration with the normative Buddhist scholasticism that became dominant in Tibet during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\""

            "Albert Abraham Michelson FFRS FRSE (surname pronunciation anglicized as \"Michael-son\", December 19, 1852 – May 9, 1931) was a Prussian-born American physicist of Jewish descent, known for his work on measuring the speed of light and especially for the Michelson–Morley experiment. In 1907 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, becoming the first American to win the Nobel Prize in a science. He was the founder and the first head of the physics departments of Case School of Applied Science (now Case Western Reserve University) and the University of Chicago."

Millikan was born in the United States, while Michelson was born in France. They were also both scientists who made significant contributions to the field of physics, but they did not work together or collaborate on any projects. Therefore, it is possible for them to never meet."

He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with \"Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton\" (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\""

            "Igor Yevgenyevich Tamm (; 8 July 1895 – 12 April 1971) was a Soviet physicist who received the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov and Ilya Mikhailovich Frank, for their 1934 discovery and demonstration of Cherenkov radiation. He also predicted the Quasi-particle Phonon, and in 1951, together with Andrei Sakharov, proposed the Tokamak system."

            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

Marcel-Béronneau was a French painter and sculptor, while Moreau was a French painter and sculptor. They were both prominent figures in the art world, but they did not have any direct contact or interaction with each other during their lifetimes. Therefore, it is possible for Pierre Amédée Marcel-Béronneau to never meet Gustave Moreau."

Born in Florence, he studied classical sculpture and used his knowledge to develop an Early Renaissance style of sculpture. He spent time in other cities, where he worked on commissions and taught others; his periods in Rome, Padua, and Siena introduced to other parts of Italy the techniques he had developed in the course of a long and productive career. His \"David\" was the first freestanding nude male sculpture since antiquity; like much of his work it was commissioned by the Medici family."

According to tibetologist David Germano, Longchenpa's work led to the dominance of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) over the other Dzogchen traditions. He is also responsible for the scholastic systematization of Dzogchen thought within the context of the wider Tibetan Vajrayana tradition of philosophy which was highly developed at the time among the Sarma schools. Germano also notes that Longchenpa's work is \"generally taken to be the definitive expression of the Great Perfection with its precise terminological distinctions, systematic scope, and integration with the normative Buddhist scholasticism that became dominant in Tibet during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\""

His music was among the most radical of its milieu in its stark concision and steadfast embrace and application of then novel atonal and twelve-tone techniques in an increasingly rigorous manner, somewhat after the Franco-Flemish School of his studies under Guido Adler. With his mentor Arnold Schoenberg and his colleague Alban Berg, Webern was at the core of those within the broader circle of the Second Viennese School. He was arguably the first and certainly the last of the three to write music in a style lauded for its aphoristic, expressionist potency, a reflection of his instincts and the idiosyncrasy of his process as a composer."

            "Nicolas Poussin (, , ; June 1594 – 19 November 1665) was the leading painter of the classical French Baroque style, although he spent most of his working life in Rome. Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors. He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscape in his paintings. His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul Cézanne."

He is widely considered one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. As a Jewish composer, Schoenberg was targeted by the Nazi Party, which labeled his works as degenerate music and forbade them from being published. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, becoming an American citizen in 1941."

A member of Les Six, his best known work is probably \"Antigone\", composed between 1924 and 1927 to the French libretto by Jean Cocteau based on the tragedy \"Antigone\" by Sophocles. It premiered on 28 December 1927 at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie with sets designed by Pablo Picasso and costumes by Coco Chanel. However, his most frequently performed work is probably the orchestral work \"Pacific 231\", which was inspired by the sound of a steam locomotive.",

            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

Regarded as one of the most distinguished pianists of the Romantic era, she exerted her influence over the course of a 61-year concert career, changing the format and repertoire of the piano recital by lessening the importance of purely virtuosic works. She also composed solo piano pieces, a piano concerto (her Op. 7), chamber music, choral pieces, and songs."

            "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence\". He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\".\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote, \"Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the Bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters."

            "Arnold Schoenberg or Schönberg (, ; ; 13 September 187413 July 1951) was an Austrian-American composer, music theorist, teacher, writer, and painter. He is widely considered one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School. As a Jewish composer, Schoenberg was targeted by the Nazi Party, which labeled his works as degenerate music and forbade them from being published. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, becoming an American citizen in 1941."

            "Paul Hindemith (, powl HIN-deh-mitt; 16 November 189528 December 1963) was a German and American composer, music theorist, teacher, violist and conductor. He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

This made her one of the first American women to earn a doctoral degree from a university in Europe. Gregory often found it difficult to find paid academic positions. She often would take on the unpaid positions because she could support herself. From 1890 to 1895 at the University of Pennsylvania and Barnard College she worked as a teaching fellow and lecturer respectively. Gregory was the first woman elected to the American Society of Naturalists in 1886."

According to tibetologist David Germano, Longchenpa's work led to the dominance of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) over the other Dzogchen traditions. He is also responsible for the scholastic systematization of Dzogchen thought within the context of the wider Tibetan Vajrayana tradition of philosophy which was highly developed at the time among the Sarma schools. Germano also notes that Longchenpa's work is \"generally taken to be the definitive expression of the Great Perfection with its precise terminological distinctions, systematic scope, and integration with the normative Buddhist scholasticism that became dominant in Tibet during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\""

According to tibetologist David Germano, Longchenpa's work led to the dominance of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) over the other Dzogchen traditions. He is also responsible for the scholastic systematization of Dzogchen thought within the context of the wider Tibetan Vajrayana tradition of philosophy which was highly developed at the time among the Sarma schools. Germano also notes that Longchenpa's work is \"generally taken to be the definitive expression of the Great Perfection with its precise terminological distinctions, systematic scope, and integration with the normative Buddhist scholasticism that became dominant in Tibet during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\""

His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style."

            "Paul Hindemith (, powl HIN-deh-mitt; 16 November 189528 December 1963) was a German and American composer, music theorist, teacher, violist and conductor. He founded the Amar Quartet in 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such as \"Kammermusik\", including works with viola and viola d'amore as solo instruments in a neo-Bachian spirit. Other notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), the opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\" (1943), and the oratorio \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1946), a requiem based on Walt Whitman's poem. Hindemith and his wife emigrated to Switzerland and the United States ahead of World War II, after worsening difficulties with the Nazi German regime. In his later years, he conducted and recorded much of his own music."

He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with \"Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton\" (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\""

            "Prodicus of Ceos (; , \"Pródikos ho Keios\"; c. 465 BC – c. 395 BC) was a Greek philosopher, and part of the first generation of Sophists. He came to Athens as ambassador from Ceos, and became known as a speaker and a teacher. Plato treats him with greater respect than the other sophists, and in several of the Platonic dialogues Socrates appears as the friend of Prodicus. One writer claims Socrates used his method of instruction. Prodicus made linguistics and ethics prominent in his curriculum. The content of one of his speeches is still known, and concerns a fable in which Heracles has to make a choice between Virtue and Vice. He also interpreted religion through the framework of naturalism.",
            "Theramenes (; ; died 404/403 BC) was an Athenian military leader and statesman, prominent in the final decade of the Peloponnesian War. He was active during the two periods of oligarchic government at Athens, the 400 and later The Thirty Tyrants, as well as in the trial of the generals who had commanded at Arginusae in 406 BC. A moderate oligarch, he often found himself caught between the democrats on the one hand and the extremist oligarchs on the other. Successful in replacing a narrow oligarchy with a broader one in 411 BC, he failed to achieve the same end in 404 BC, and was executed by the extremists whose policies he had opposed."

As an intellectual of the Italian Renaissance (15th–16th c.), Pietro Bembo greatly influenced the development of the Tuscan dialect as a literary language for poetry and prose, which, by later codification into a standard language, became the modern Italian language. In the 16th century, Bembo's poetry, essays and books proved basic to reviving interest in the literary works of Petrarch. In the field of music, Bembo's literary writing techniques helped composers develop the techniques of musical composition that made the madrigal the most important secular music of 16th-century Italy."

He also made significant contributions to the development of the welfare state and the establishment of the National Health Service.

Dashiell Hammett was a renowned American detective novelist, while Philippe Pétain was a French military leader and politician who served as the Prime Minister of France during World War II. While Pétain's actions during the war were controversial and led to his conviction and imprisonment, Hammett's writing had a significant impact on the genre of detective fiction and continues to be widely read and admired today.

While Sun Yat-sen did hold many important positions and made significant contributions to Chinese history, it is not appropriate to compare his career to that of a painter and sculptor. Additionally, success and impact cannot be measured solely by the number of notable works or positions held, as there are many other factors that contribute to a person's overall legacy and influence."

Leopold was a moderate proponent of enlightened absolutism. He granted the Academy of Georgofili his protection. Unusually for his time, he opposed the death penalty and torture and abolished it in Tuscany in November 30th 1786 during his rule there, making it the first nation in modern history to do so. In honor of this, starting by 2000, every 30th of November has become a regional custom, known as the Festival of Tuscany, which also became law in 2001 for the law's 215th anniversary.

Rising from obscurity, she came to the notice of Charles II, who employed her as a spy in Antwerp. Upon her return to London and a probable brief stay in debtors' prison, she began writing for the stage. She belonged to a coterie of poets and famous libertines such as John Wilmot, Lord Rochester. Behn wrote under the pastoral pseudonym Astrea. During the turbulent political times of the Exclusion Crisis, she wrote an epilogue and prologue that brought her legal trouble; she thereafter devoted most of her writing to prose genres and translations. A staunch supporter of the Stuart line, Behn declined an invitation from Bishop Burnet to write a welcoming poem to the new king William III. She died shortly after."

He is widely seen as one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century but routinely compared by Italian critics to his older contemporary Alessandro Manzoni despite expressing \"diametrically opposite positions.\" Although he lived in a secluded town in the conservative Papal States, he came into contact with the main ideas of the Enlightenment, and, through his own literary evolution, created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era. The strongly lyrical quality of his poetry made him a central figure on the European and international literary and cultural landscape.",

Rachmaninoff is widely considered one of the finest pianists of his day and, as a composer, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian classical music. Early influences of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers gave way to a thoroughly personal idiom notable for its song-like melodicism, expressiveness, dense contrapuntal textures, and rich orchestral colours. The piano is featured prominently in Rachmaninoff's compositional output and he used his skills as a performer to fully explore the expressive and technical possibilities of the instrument."

John Henry is known for his work on the Transcontinental Railroad, which was a massive engineering feat that required extensive planning and coordination. He also held several high-level positions in the railroad industry, including the position of Chief Engineer. In contrast, Georges-Eugène Haussmann was a French urban planner and engineer who is best known for his work on the renovation of Paris in the mid-19th century. While he made significant contributions to the city's infrastructure, his work was primarily focused on urban planning and design, rather than engineering. Therefore, based on the criteria of notable works and positions held, John Henry's career can be considered more successful than Georges-Eugène Haussmann's."

While Reiner's beliefs are not explicitly stated, he has been known to express a sense of spirituality and a belief in the existence of a higher power. Therefore, both individuals share a common belief in the existence of a higher power or deity, which could be considered a shared worldview or religion belief."

Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as the Lord Edward. The eldest son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was held hostage by the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward left to join the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land in 1270. He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed of his father's death. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey."
