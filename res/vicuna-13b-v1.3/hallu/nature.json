Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an S-type asteroid, the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt. On 28 August 1993, Ida was visited by the uncrewed \"Galileo\" spacecraft while en route to Jupiter. It was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite.",

It is estimated to be 5 meters in diameter, which means that it poses no threat if it impacts Earth. An impact would have the kinetic energy of about 3 kt of TNT, and would probably result in an air burst in the upper atmosphere. It is the least threatening asteroid listed on the Sentry Risk Table. The very short observation arc of only 3 hours results in a very poorly constrained orbit, and it could just as easily be 2 AU from Earth on 7 March 2113."
