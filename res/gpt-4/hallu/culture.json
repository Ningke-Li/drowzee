It is a process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether considered subjective or objective. William James (1890) wrote that \"Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence.\" Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources. Attention is manifested by an attentional bottleneck, in terms of the amount of data the brain can process each second; for example, in human vision, only less than 1% of the visual input data (at around one megabyte per second) can enter the bottleneck, leading to inattentional blindness."

Organizationally, the tone poem consists of four informal sections, each of which corresponds to one of the poem's four stanzas and evokes the mood of a particular episode: first, heroic vigor; second, frenetic activity; third, sensual love; and fourth, inconsolable grief."

Therefore, they belong to different categories, one being social drama and the other being historical biography."

The book chronicles the investigative reporting of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward's initial report on the Watergate break-in through the resignations of Nixon Administration officials H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman in April 1973, and the revelation of the Oval Office Watergate tapes by Alexander Butterfield three months later. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the \"Post\", naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably Hugh Sloan. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source Deep Throat, whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years. Gene Roberts, the former executive editor of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" and former managing editor of \"The New York Times\", has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein \"maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time.\""

The book also contends that Vichy France attempted to protect French Jews during World War II, a theory that attracted widespread criticism.

It is loosely based on the 1981 novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" by Gary K. Wolf. The film stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, Stubby Kaye, and Joanna Cassidy, with the voices of Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. Combining live-action and animation, the film is set in an alternate history Hollywood in 1947, where humans and cartoon characters (referred to as \"toons\") co-exist. Its plot follows Eddie Valiant, a private investigator with a grudge against toons, who must help exonerate Roger Rabbit, a toon framed for murder. The film was one of the final productions in which Mel Blanc voiced his \"Looney Tunes\" characters before his death a year later in 1989."

            "Cryptic Writings is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth. Released on June 17, 1997, through Capitol Records, it was the band's last studio album to feature drummer Nick Menza. His departure would mark the end of the band's longest lasting lineup to date, having recorded four studio albums. Megadeth decided to produce the record with Dann Huff in Nashville, Tennessee, because they were not satisfied with their previous producer Max Norman. The album features twelve tracks with accessible song structures, specifically aimed for radio airplay. The lyrics were also altered, in order to make the music more inclusive for wider audience. These changes were met with mixed opinions from music critics, who noted the band moving away from their thrash metal roots."

            "Ravenloft is a campaign setting for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" roleplaying game. It is an alternate time-space existence known as a \"pocket dimension\" or demiplane, called the Demiplane of Dread, which consists of a collection of land pieces called \"domains\", brought together by a mysterious force known only as the Dark Powers. Each domain is tailored to and mystically ruled by a being called a Darklord who is forever trapped and surrounded by magical mists surrounding the domain. Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire in the original \"AD&amp;D\" \"Ravenloft\" I6 module 1983, became the first Darklord, both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia. The story of how Count von Zarovich became darklord of Barovia was detailed in the 1993 novel '. As originally established in the ' boxed set known as \"the Black Box\" released in 1990, the Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane. As a physical manifestation of that plane, lands, monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists, and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported, but means of escape were few. Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various AD&amp;D 2nd edition (and then later in 3rd edition) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands."

Heinlein, published in 1947, features three teenagers who participate in a pioneering flight to the Moon. It was the first in the Heinlein juveniles, a long and successful series of science-fiction novels published by Scribner's. Heinlein originally envisioned the novel as the first of a series of books called \"Young Rocket Engineers\". Publishers initially rejected the script, judging going to the moon as \"too far out\"."

Although Vanjikottai Valiban may have been inspired by The Count of Monte Cristo, it is not the original work. The Count of Monte Cristo was published in 1844, long before the release of Vanjikottai Valiban in 1958. Therefore, The Count of Monte Cristo is the original work, not Vanjikottai Valiban."

It was recorded on a three-speed Uher machine and was mastered/engineered by Bob Ludwig. It was released as a double album in July 1975 by RCA Records, but taken off the market three weeks later. A radical departure from the rest of his catalog, the \"Metal Machine Music\" album features no songs or recognizably structured compositions, eschewing melody and rhythm for modulated feedback and noise music guitar effects, mixed at varying speeds by Reed. Also in 1975, RCA released a Quadrophonic version of the \"Metal Machine Music\" recording that was produced by playing it back both forward and backward, and by flipping the tape over."

Therefore, it's not accurate to say that Counter-Reformation is the successor style of Baroque painting because they are not comparable terms; one is a historical period and the other is an artistic style."

While choosing a name, they realize that the Washington Redskins American football team has lost its trademark on \"Redskins\" because it is racially disparaging to Native Americans, so they decide to use that name for their company. The new company receives enough money for the boys to live luxuriously without doing any work, until the football team destroys Kickstarter's servers during a raid, preventing the boys from accessing their startup company page and receiving their money."

For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

The song was performed by María Ólafs. The Icelandic entry for the 2015 contest in Vienna, Austria was selected through the national final \"Söngvakeppnin 2015\", organised by the Icelandic broadcaster Ríkisútvarpið (RÚV). The selection consisted of two semi-finals and a final, held on 31 January, 7 February and 14 February 2015, respectively. Six songs competed in each semi-final with the top three as selected by a public televote alongside a jury wildcard advancing to the final. In the final, the winner was selected over two rounds of voting: the first involved a 50/50 combination of jury voting and public televoting, which reduced the seven competing entries to two superfinalists and the second round selected the winner exclusively through public televoting. \"Unbroken\" performed by María Ólafs emerged as the winner after gaining 55.89% of the public vote."

His departure would mark the end of the band's longest lasting lineup to date, having recorded four studio albums. Megadeth decided to produce the record with Dann Huff in Nashville, Tennessee, because they were not satisfied with their previous producer Max Norman. The album features twelve tracks with accessible song structures, specifically aimed for radio airplay. The lyrics were also altered, in order to make the music more inclusive for wider audience. These changes were met with mixed opinions from music critics, who noted the band moving away from their thrash metal roots.",

While it draws inspiration from the saga, it is not the original work of the Völsunga saga. The Völsunga saga is an Icelandic prose saga which is itself a part of the older Norse saga tradition."

It is thought to have been renamed \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" to distinguish it from \"Oedipus at Colonus\", a later play by Sophocles. In antiquity, the term \"tyrant\" referred to a ruler with no legitimate claim to rule, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation."

Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide."

            "Nine Inch Nails, commonly abbreviated as NIN and stylized as NIИ, is an American industrial rock band formed in Cleveland in 1988. Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Trent Reznor was the only permanent member of the band until his frequent collaborator, Atticus Ross, joined in 2016. The band's debut album, \"Pretty Hate Machine\" (1989), was released via TVT Records. After disagreeing with TVT about how to promote the album, the band signed with Interscope Records and released the EP \"Broken\" (1992). The following albums, \"The Downward Spiral\" (1994) and \"The Fragile\" (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success."

Their lyrics have political and philosophical themes influenced by the Surrealist and Situationist movements. On stage, they play in a more feedback-driven and guitar-oriented style.

Although it was grouped among the comedies, many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending."

            "Ravenloft is a campaign setting for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" roleplaying game. It is an alternate time-space existence known as a \"pocket dimension\" or demiplane, called the Demiplane of Dread, which consists of a collection of land pieces called \"domains\", brought together by a mysterious force known only as the Dark Powers. Each domain is tailored to and mystically ruled by a being called a Darklord who is forever trapped and surrounded by magical mists surrounding the domain. Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire in the original \"AD&amp;D\" \"Ravenloft\" I6 module 1983, became the first Darklord, both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia. The story of how Count von Zarovich became darklord of Barovia was detailed in the 1993 novel '. As originally established in the ' boxed set known as \"the Black Box\" released in 1990, the Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane. As a physical manifestation of that plane, lands, monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists, and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported, but means of escape were few. Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various AD&amp;D 2nd edition (and then later in 3rd edition) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Therefore, Operation Ivy cannot be the successor style of Green Day as they were contemporaries and not sequential. Furthermore, Green Day's style was influenced by bands like Operation Ivy, not the other way around."

Pygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw, first presented in 1913, and it is based on a Greek mythological character. On the other hand, Pimmalione is an opera by Luigi Cherubini, first performed in 1809. Therefore, Pimmalione is not the original work of Pygmalion."

On the other hand, Myrkur is a Danish band that was formed in 2014 by Amalie Bruun. While both bands play black metal, their styles are distinct and unique, and Myrkur's style is not a direct evolution or successor of Mayhem's style. Therefore, it is true that Mayhem is not the successor style of Myrkur."

For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Les Automatistes, a Canadian art movement that also emphasized spontaneous, subconscious creation, emerged later in the 1940s. However, Les Automatistes was influenced by Surrealism and its automatism, not the other way around. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that surrealist automatism is the successor style of Les Automatistes."

Wishbone Ash is known for their progressive rock and blues sound, while Van Halen is known for their hard rock and heavy metal sound. Furthermore, Wishbone Ash was formed in 1969, while Van Halen was formed in 1972, so it would be chronologically impossible for Wishbone Ash to be a successor style of Van Halen."

Although the latter may have been inspired by the former, it is not the original work."

            "Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford, Hertfordshire in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\". Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide."

Scholarly opinion varies, but the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" specifies the period when Middle English was spoken as being from 1150 to 1500. This stage of the development of the English language roughly followed the High to the Late Middle Ages."

The evolution of the English language is generally classified into Old English (or Anglo-Saxon), Middle English, Early Modern English, and Modern English. Middle English, used from the 12th to late 15th century, evolved into Early Modern English, used from the late 15th to late 17th century. Therefore, Early Modern English comes after Middle English, not before."

Often called a genius for his novel approaches to pop composition, extraordinary musical aptitude, and mastery of recording techniques, he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the 20th century. His best-known work is distinguished for its high production values, complex harmonies and orchestrations, layered vocals, and introspective or ingenuous themes. Wilson is also known for his formerly high-ranged singing and for his lifelong struggles with mental illness."

            "Fluxus was an international, interdisciplinary community of artists, composers, designers and poets during the 1960s and 1970s who engaged in experimental art performances which emphasized the artistic process over the finished product. Fluxus is known for experimental contributions to different artistic media and disciplines and for generating new art forms. These art forms include intermedia, a term coined by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins; conceptual art, first developed by Henry Flynt, an artist contentiously associated with Fluxus; and video art, first pioneered by Nam June Paik and Wolf Vostell. Dutch gallerist and art critic Harry Ruhé describes Fluxus as \"the most radical and experimental art movement of the sixties\"."

Instead, his works and ideas greatly influenced the Fluxus movement."

The German entry for the 2015 contest in Vienna, Austria was selected through the national final \"Unser Song für Österreich\", organised by the German broadcaster ARD in collaboration with Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR). The national final took place on 3 March 2015 and featured eight competing acts, one of which was selected through a Club Concert wildcard round. The winner was selected through three rounds of public televoting, and \"Heart of Stone\" performed by Andreas Kümmert initially announced as the German entry for Vienna after gaining 78.7% of the votes in the third round, however the artist immediately forfeited his victory upon the announcement. The confirmation of national final runner-up \"Black Smoke\" performed by Ann Sophie as the German entry occurred during a post-show press conference. The unprecedented withdrawal of Kümmert garnered international media interest."

In addition to participating in the contest, the Austrian broadcaster Österreichischer Rundfunk (ORF) also hosted the Eurovision Song Contest after winning the competition in 2014 with the song \"Rise Like a Phoenix\" performed by Conchita Wurst. ORF organised the national final \"Wer singt für Österreich?\" in order to select the Austrian entry for the 2015 contest in Vienna. Sixteen artists competed over three televised shows resulting in the selection of six finalists with a potential Eurovision song each. In the final, ten international juries and a public vote first selected the top two entries to proceed to a second round of voting. In the second round, \"I Am Yours\" performed by The Makemakes was selected as the winner after gaining 78% of the votes from a public vote."

            "Ravenloft is a campaign setting for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" roleplaying game. It is an alternate time-space existence known as a \"pocket dimension\" or demiplane, called the Demiplane of Dread, which consists of a collection of land pieces called \"domains\", brought together by a mysterious force known only as the Dark Powers. Each domain is tailored to and mystically ruled by a being called a Darklord who is forever trapped and surrounded by magical mists surrounding the domain. Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire in the original \"AD&amp;D\" \"Ravenloft\" I6 module 1983, became the first Darklord, both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia. The story of how Count von Zarovich became darklord of Barovia was detailed in the 1993 novel '. As originally established in the ' boxed set known as \"the Black Box\" released in 1990, the Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane. As a physical manifestation of that plane, lands, monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists, and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported, but means of escape were few. Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various AD&amp;D 2nd edition (and then later in 3rd edition) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands."

After the sacred Shikon Jewel re-emerges from deep inside Kagome's body, she inadvertently shatters it into dozens of fragments that scatter across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome set to recover the Jewel's fragments, and through their quest they are joined by the lecherous monk Miroku, the demon slayer Sango, and the fox demon Shippō. Together, they journey to restore the Shikon Jewel before it falls into the hands of the evil half-demon Naraku."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Therefore, The Wizard of Oz is not the original work of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but rather a derivative work based on the original novel."

The series begins with Kagome Higurashi, a fifteen-year-old middle school girl from modern-day Tokyo who is transported to the Sengoku period after falling into a well in her family shrine, where she meets the half-dog demon, half-human Inuyasha. After the sacred Shikon Jewel re-emerges from deep inside Kagome's body, she inadvertently shatters it into dozens of fragments that scatter across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome set to recover the Jewel's fragments, and through their quest they are joined by the lecherous monk Miroku, the demon slayer Sango, and the fox demon Shippō. Together, they journey to restore the Shikon Jewel before it falls into the hands of the evil half-demon Naraku."

Top Cat Begins, on the other hand, is a 2015 animated film that tells the backstory of the characters from the original series. Therefore, it is not the original work but a later addition to the Top Cat franchise."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

            "Ravenloft is a campaign setting for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" roleplaying game. It is an alternate time-space existence known as a \"pocket dimension\" or demiplane, called the Demiplane of Dread, which consists of a collection of land pieces called \"domains\", brought together by a mysterious force known only as the Dark Powers. Each domain is tailored to and mystically ruled by a being called a Darklord who is forever trapped and surrounded by magical mists surrounding the domain. Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire in the original \"AD&amp;D\" \"Ravenloft\" I6 module 1983, became the first Darklord, both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia. The story of how Count von Zarovich became darklord of Barovia was detailed in the 1993 novel '. As originally established in the ' boxed set known as \"the Black Box\" released in 1990, the Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane. As a physical manifestation of that plane, lands, monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists, and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported, but means of escape were few. Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various AD&amp;D 2nd edition (and then later in 3rd edition) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands."

Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.",

It is a collection of mythological and legendary stories, in which transformation (metamorphosis) plays a role, however, Ariane et Bacchus is not the original work of this collection. Ariane et Bacchus is a French opera by Marin Marais. While it may draw on the same mythological themes, it is not the original work of Metamorphoses."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Green Day, on the other hand, is a punk rock band that was formed in the 1980s and became popular in the 1990s. Therefore, it's not possible for the Ramones to be the successor style of Green Day because the Ramones' music and style predate Green Day. In fact, Green Day has often cited the Ramones as one of their major influences."

Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities and slang pervade the rock opera's lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

In fact, Green Day has cited The Replacements as an influence on their music."

Aerosmith is sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is sometimes referred to as the \"Toxic Twins\".",

It details the story of a young girl named Alice who falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures. It is seen as an example of the literary nonsense genre. The artist John Tenniel provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the book. "

Their lyrics have political and philosophical themes influenced by the Surrealist and Situationist movements. On stage, they play in a more feedback-driven and guitar-oriented style. The band also draw from funk, jazz and Brazilian music, and were one of the first bands to be dubbed \"post-rock\". "

It is widely observed in Mexico, where it largely developed, and is also observed in other places, especially by people of Mexican heritage. Although related to the simultaneous Christian remembrances for Hallowtide, it has a much less solemn tone and is portrayed as a holiday of joyful celebration rather than mourning. Some argue that there are Indigenous Mexican or ancient Aztec influences that account for the custom, and it has become a way to remember those forebears of Mexican culture. The multi-day holiday involves family and friends gathering to pay respects and to remember friends and family members who have died. These celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about the departed."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\". Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Books IIII were first published in 1590, then republished in 1596 together with books IVVI. \"The Faerie Queene\" is notable for its form: at over 36,000 lines and over 4,000 stanzas, it is one of the longest poems in the English language; it is also the work in which Spenser invented the verse form known as the Spenserian stanza. On a literal level, the poem follows several knights as a means to examine different virtues, and though the text is primarily an allegorical work, it can be read on several levels of allegory, including as praise (or, later, criticism) of Queen Elizabeth I. In Spenser's \"Letter of the Authors\", he states that the entire epic poem is \"cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devices\", and that the aim of publishing \"The Faerie Queene\" was to \"fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline\"."

It is a well-documented and studied piece of literature with a known author and content. Therefore, it is not possible for \"The Story of Candace\" to be the original work of \"The Faerie Queene\" unless it is a part or an adaptation of the original work, but it cannot be the original work itself."

It is loosely based on the 1981 novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" by Gary K. Wolf. The film stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, Stubby Kaye, and Joanna Cassidy, with the voices of Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. Combining live-action and animation, the film is set in an alternate history Hollywood in 1947, where humans and cartoon characters (referred to as \"toons\") co-exist. Its plot follows Eddie Valiant, a private investigator with a grudge against toons, who must help exonerate Roger Rabbit, a toon framed for murder. The film was one of the final productions in which Mel Blanc voiced his \"Looney Tunes\" characters before his death a year later in 1989."

She refuses and is disowned by Lear. He becomes destitute and insane and a proscribed crux of political machinations. The first known performance of any version of Shakespeare's play was on Saint Stephen's Day in 1606. Modern editors derive their texts from three extant publications: the 1608 quarto (Q1), the 1619 quarto (Q2, unofficial and based on Q1), and the 1623 First Folio. The quarto versions differ significantly from the folio version."

It is an alternate time-space existence known as a \"pocket dimension\" or demiplane, called the Demiplane of Dread, which consists of a collection of land pieces called \"domains\", brought together by a mysterious force known only as the Dark Powers. Each domain is tailored to and mystically ruled by a being called a Darklord who is forever trapped and surrounded by magical mists surrounding the domain. Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire in the original \"AD&amp;D\" \"Ravenloft\" I6 module 1983, became the first Darklord, both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia. The story of how Count von Zarovich became darklord of Barovia was detailed in the 1993 novel '. As originally established in the ' boxed set known as \"the Black Box\" released in 1990, the Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane. As a physical manifestation of that plane, lands, monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists, and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported, but means of escape were few. Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various AD&amp;D 2nd edition (and then later in 3rd edition) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

It is thought to have been renamed \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" to distinguish it from \"Oedipus at Colonus\", a later play by Sophocles. In antiquity, the term \"tyrant\" referred to a ruler with no legitimate claim to rule, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation."

Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide."

Furthermore, Jeff Beck's career started in the 1960s, predating Van Halen's rise to fame in the late 1970s. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that Jeff Beck is a successor style of Van Halen."

They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\". Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide."

It is thought to have been renamed \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" to distinguish it from \"Oedipus at Colonus\", a later play by Sophocles. In antiquity, the term \"tyrant\" referred to a ruler with no legitimate claim to rule, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation."

Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Led by the songwriting team of Tim Gane and Lætitia Sadier, the group's sound features influences from krautrock and 1960s pop music, often incorporating a repetitive motorik beat with the use of vintage electronic keyboards and female vocals sung in English and French. Their lyrics have political and philosophical themes influenced by the Surrealist and Situationist movements. On stage, they play in a more feedback-driven and guitar-oriented style. The band also draw from funk, jazz and Brazilian music, and were one of the first bands to be dubbed \"post-rock\". "

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

            "The Moody Blues were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in May 1964. The band initially consisted of drummer Graeme Edge, guitarist/vocalist Denny Laine, keyboardist/vocalist Mike Pinder, multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Ray Thomas, and bassist/vocalist Clint Warwick. Originally part of the British beat and R&amp;B scene of the early–mid 1960s, the band came to prominence with the UK No. 1 and US Top 10 single \"Go Now\" in late 1964/early 1965. Laine and Warwick left the band by the end of 1966, being replaced by guitarist/vocalist Justin Hayward and bassist/vocalist John Lodge. They embraced the psychedelic rock movement of the late 1960s, with their second album, 1967's \"Days of Future Passed\", being a fusion of rock with classical music (performed with the London Festival Orchestra) that established the band as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a \"landmark\" and \"one of the first successful concept albums\".",
            "Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford, Hertfordshire in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\". Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide."

        "llm_answer": "Yes, because The Moody Blues and Deep Purple are both rock bands, but they have different styles and originated in different periods. The Moody Blues was formed in 1964 and is known for its fusion of rock with classical music elements, while Deep Purple, formed in 1968, is recognized as one of the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock. Therefore, The Moody Blues is not the successor style of Deep Purple."

Perfumes can be defined as substances that emit and diffuse a pleasant and fragrant odor. They consist of manmade mixtures of aromatic chemicals and essential oils. The 1939 Nobel Laureate for Chemistry, Leopold Ružička stated in 1945 that \"right from the earliest days of scientific chemistry up to the present time, perfumes have substantially contributed to the development of organic chemistry as regards methods, systematic classification, and theory.\""

            "Space Cadet is a 1948 science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein about Matt Dodson, who joins the Interplanetary Patrol to help preserve peace in the Solar System. The story translates the standard military academy story into outer space: a boy from Iowa goes to officer school, sees action and adventure, shoulders responsibilities far beyond his experience, and becomes a man. It was published as the second of the series of Heinlein juveniles and inspired the media franchise around the character Tom Corbett, including the 1950s television series \"Tom Corbett, Space Cadet\" and radio show which made \"Space Cadet\" a household phrase whose meaning later shifted in popular culture."

On the other hand, A Christmas Carol is a novella written by Charles Dickens in 1843. Although they both have 'Carol' in their titles, they are not the same work. Therefore, An American Carol is not the original work of A Christmas Carol."

            "\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". It was written primarily by John Lennon with assistance from Paul McCartney, and credited to the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership. Lennon's son Julian inspired the song with a nursery school drawing that he called \"Lucy – in the sky with diamonds\". Shortly before the album's release, speculation arose that the first letter of each of the nouns in the title intentionally spelled \"LSD\", the initialism commonly used for the hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide. Lennon repeatedly denied that he had intended it as a drug song, and attributed the song's fantastical imagery to his reading of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\" books."

            "The Taming of the Shrew is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1590 and 1592. The play begins with a framing device, often referred to as the induction, in which a mischievous nobleman tricks a drunken tinker named Christopher Sly into believing he is actually a nobleman himself. The nobleman then has the play performed for Sly's diversion."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Joe Jackson, a British musician and singer-songwriter, emerged in the late 1970s with a style that blends new wave, jazz, and pop. On the other hand, Green Day, an American punk rock band, rose to fame in the 1990s. Their music is characterized by punk rock, pop punk, and alternative rock. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that Joe Jackson is the successor style of Green Day."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

            "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

            "Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford, Hertfordshire in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\". Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.",

            "The Godfather Part III is a 1990 American crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from the screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo. The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Andy García, Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, George Hamilton, and Sofia Coppola. It is the third and final installment in \"The Godfather\" trilogy. A sequel to \"The Godfather\" (1972) and \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974), it concludes the fictional story of Michael Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone family who attempts to legitimize his criminal empire. The film also includes fictionalized accounts of two real-life events: the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981–1982, both linked to Michael Corleone's business affairs.",
            "The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film. The film is produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, loosely based on the 1969 novel \"The Godfather\" by Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. It is both a sequel and a prequel to the 1972 film \"The Godfather\", presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the new Don of the Corleone family, protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the prequel covers the journey of his father, Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City. The ensemble cast also features Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Morgana King, John Cazale, Mariana Hill, and Lee Strasberg."

For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

Therefore, Buzzcocks cannot be the successor style of Green Day because they were active before Green Day was even formed. In fact, it could be argued that Green Day was influenced by the style of Buzzcocks and other punk rock bands of the 70s and 80s."

Fluxus is known for experimental contributions to different artistic media and disciplines and for generating new art forms. These art forms include intermedia, a term coined by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins; conceptual art, first developed by Henry Flynt, an artist contentiously associated with Fluxus; and video art, first pioneered by Nam June Paik and Wolf Vostell. Dutch gallerist and art critic Harry Ruhé describes Fluxus as \"the most radical and experimental art movement of the sixties\"."

The Wiz, on the other hand, is a Broadway musical that was first performed in 1974. It reimagines the characters and story of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in the context of African American culture. Therefore, The Wiz is not the original work but an adaptation."

Although now considered a major novel of the 19th century, \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" received mixed reviews when it first appeared, in part because it challenged the sexual morals of late Victorian England."

Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\". Deep Purple (together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity\" of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies. They were listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide."

For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S."

On the other hand, Van Halen is an American hard rock band that came to prominence in the late 1970s. Their music styles, influences, and contributions to the music industry are distinct. Therefore, The Dave Clark Five cannot be considered as the successor style of Van Halen."

            "The Nemean lion (; ; ) was a monster in Greek mythology that lived at Nemea. Eventually, it was killed by Heracles (Hercules). Because its golden fur was impervious to attack, it could not be killed with mortals' weapons. Its claws were sharper than mortals' swords and could destroy any strong armour. In \"Bibliotheca\", Photius wrote that the dragon Ladon, who guarded the golden apples, was his brother."

It was a vicious monster in Greek mythology that lived at Nemea and was eventually killed by Heracles. The gender of the Nemean lion is not explicitly stated in the myth, but it is often assumed to be male due to the language used in the stories."
