            "Beemster () is a former municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. The Beemster is the first so-called polder in the Netherlands that was reclaimed from a lake, the water being extracted from the lake by windmills. The Beemster polder was drained between 1609 and 1612. It has preserved intact its well-ordered landscape of fields, roads, canals, dykes and settlements, laid out in accordance with classical and Renaissance planning principles. A grid of canals parallels the grid of roads in the Beemster. The grids are offset: the larger feeder canals are offset by approximately one kilometer from the larger roads."

There are three popular variants of the game: \"punto banco\", \"baccarat chemin de fer\", and \"baccarat banque\" (or \"à deux tableaux\"). In \"punto banco\", each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt. In \"baccarat chemin de fer\" and \"baccarat banque\", by contrast, both players can make choices. The winning odds are in favour of the bank, with a house edge of at least 1 percent."

            "Baccarat or baccara (; ) is a card game played at casinos. It is a comparing card game played between two hands, the \"player\" and the \"banker\". Each baccarat coup (round of play) has three possible outcomes: \"player\" (player has the higher score), \"banker\", and \"tie\". There are three popular variants of the game: \"punto banco\", \"baccarat chemin de fer\", and \"baccarat banque\" (or \"à deux tableaux\"). In \"punto banco\", each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt. In \"baccarat chemin de fer\" and \"baccarat banque\", by contrast, both players can make choices. The winning odds are in favour of the bank, with a house edge of at least 1 percent."

The northern terminus of the Pennsylvania segment is at an at-grade intersection with Musser Lane just before reaching I-80 near Bellefonte. The New York segment follows US 15 from the Pennsylvania–New York border to an interchange with I-86 in Corning. Within Pennsylvania, I-99 passes through Altoona and State College—the latter home to the Pennsylvania State University—and is entirely concurrent with US 220.

            "The Moulton Courthouse Square Historic District is a historic district in Moulton, Alabama. Moulton's development began in 1820, when it was chosen as the county seat of the newly formed Lawrence County. The first courthouse was a log structure; a log jail on the west side of the square operated until 1911, when it was replaced with the current, 3-story brick jail and courthouse annex. Due to its lack of rail and river connections, development around the square remained sparse. The log courthouse was replaced in 1860 with a two-story, square building with Classical Revival details. The cotton economy of Lawrence County rebounded after the Civil War with the construction of several cotton gins, though nearly all of the structures built along the square in the late 19th century were later razed and replaced. The oldest extant buildings in the district were built in 1911: the three-story courthouse annex, and the two-story, stone faced Citizens' Bank building. The northern part of Market Street, on the west side of the square, were constructed during the early 1920s. Lawrence County's economy received a boost from New Deal programs, most notably the Tennessee Valley Authority's fertilizer program and construction of Wheeler Dam. Most of the square's buildings were constructed during the late 1930s and 1940s, in contrast to most historic downtowns around the South. The current courthouse was completed in 1936. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998."

Although both are tropical, the rainforest climate is characterized by heavy rainfall throughout the year, while the monsoon climate has a distinct dry season. In terms of world heritage designation, Santo Domingo has the Colonial City of Santo Domingo listed by UNESCO, while Metro Manila has three: the Baroque Churches of the Philippines, the Historic City of Vigan, and the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras.
