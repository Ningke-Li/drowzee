Cruithne does not orbit Earth and at times it is on the other side of the Sun, placing Cruithne well outside of Earth's Hill sphere. Its orbit takes it near the orbit of Mercury and outside the orbit of Mars. Cruithne orbits the Sun in about one Earth year, but it takes 770 years for the series to complete a horseshoe-shaped movement around Earth.",

It is believed to have a mineral composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, like Ceres, though significantly less hydrated than Ceres. It is the third-largest asteroid in the Solar System by both volume and mass, and is a likely remnant protoplanet. It is 79% the mass of Vesta and 22% the mass of Ceres, constituting an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt. Its estimated volume is equivalent to a sphere in diameter, 90–95% the volume of Vesta."

Its spectral type is not clearly defined but it is known to have a variable spectrum, possibly due to its cometary activity. On the other hand, 2 Pallas is a large asteroid and is classified as a B-type asteroid, which is a part of the broader C-group of carbonaceous asteroids. Therefore, they are not similar in terms of their spectral type."
