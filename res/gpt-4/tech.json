A University of Bonn report holds that they are \"usually defined as metropolitan areas with a total population of 10 million or more people\".

            " known as \"Final Fantasy II\" for its initial North American release, is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1991, it is the fourth main installment of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. \"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced innovations that became staples of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent \"Final Fantasy\" games, and unlike prior games in the series, \"IV\" gave each character their own unchangeable character class.",

Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature."

Set in a fictional pizzeria, the player takes on the role of night security guard Jeremy Fitzgerald, who must defend themselves from the restaurant's hostile animatronic mascots while in their office. The player has access to security cameras throughout the restaurant to monitor animatronic activity. Wearing an animatronic mask allows the player to avoid being detected in most cases, though some animatronics are repelled through other methods. If an animatronic enters the office and the player is detected, they will be killed. As the game progresses, Atari-styled minigames and phone calls provide insight on the history of the restaurant.",

Wearing an animatronic mask allows the player to avoid being detected in most cases, though some animatronics are repelled through other methods. If an animatronic enters the office and the player is detected, they will be killed. As the game progresses, Atari-styled minigames and phone calls provide insight on the history of the restaurant."

The compatibility of these games with a system would depend on the specific system's hardware and software capabilities, not on the games themselves."

In private clouds, storage space and client connection limits are determined exclusively by the users' own infrastructure and settings rather than the terms and conditions of a cloud service provider. Additionally, organizations, whose data privacy policies bar them from using public cloud services can draw on Seafile to build a file sharing system of their own."

The \"Dark Alliance\" series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.",

In Valhalla, the einherjar eat their fill of the nightly resurrecting beast Sæhrímnir, and valkyries bring them mead from the udder of the goat Heiðrún. The einherjar prepare daily for the events of Ragnarök, when they will advance for an immense battle at the field of Vígríðr."

It can be used on various operating systems that support video playback, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nOn the other hand, IBM Db2 is a family of data management products, including the Db2 relational database. The products provide flexible and powerful database technology to manage core business data. IBM Db2 can be used on multiple operating systems, including Linux, UNIX, and Windows.\n\nTherefore, both DivX and IBM Db2 can be used on different operating systems, but they serve completely different purposes."

            "The Neverhood (released in Japan as Klaymen Klaymen: The Mystery of Neverhood) is a 1996 point-and-click adventure video game developed by The Neverhood, Inc. and published by DreamWorks Interactive for Microsoft Windows. The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence. It received a sequel in 1998, \"Skullmonkeys\", which was a platform game, abandoning the adventure format of the original.",

Theo Halliday and Giles Gilbert Scott. The station is one of the world's largest brick buildings and notable for its original, Art Deco interior fittings and decor."

Therefore, the statement 'Avian is not designed by Boeing 737' is true because Avian and Boeing 737 are unrelated; one is a term related to birds and the other is a specific model of an airplane."

The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence. It received a sequel in 1998, \"Skullmonkeys\", which was a platform game, abandoning the adventure format of the original."

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

            "Millipedes (from Latin , meaning \"wood louse\", which in turn is from Latin , \"thousand\", and , \"foot\") are a group of arthropods that are characterised by having two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments; they are known scientifically as the class Diplopoda, the name derived from this feature. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

            "The A-0 system (\"Arithmetic Language version 0\"), written by Grace Murray Hopper in 1951 and 1952 for the UNIVAC I, was an early compiler related tool developed for electronic computers. The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",
            "Millipedes (from Latin , meaning \"wood louse\", which in turn is from Latin , \"thousand\", and , \"foot\") are a group of arthropods that are characterised by having two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments; they are known scientifically as the class Diplopoda, the name derived from this feature. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure.

            " known as \"Final Fantasy II\" for its initial North American release, is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1991, it is the fourth main installment of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. \"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced innovations that became staples of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent \"Final Fantasy\" games, and unlike prior games in the series, \"IV\" gave each character their own unchangeable character class."

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code.

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together.

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure.

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code.

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions.

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs.

Design work was started by their company, Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), and was completed after the company had been acquired by Remington Rand (which later became part of Sperry, now Unisys). In the years before successor models of the UNIVAC I appeared, the machine was simply known as \"the UNIVAC\".",

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program."

While primarily associated with the Soviet Union, it has been used by many countries since the 1970s. It is chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge, which replaced the 7.62×39mm cartridge of Kalashnikov's earlier automatic weapons for the Soviet armed forces.",

It was based on a design by American firearms inventor John Browning, and completed by Dieudonné Saive at FN Herstal. Browning died in 1926, several years before the design was finalized. FN Herstal named it the \"High Power\" in allusion to the 13-round magazine capacity, almost twice that of other designs at the time, such as the Luger or Colt M1911."

When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence.

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions.

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball.

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."

Laid down in 1943 by the Caproni company in Milan as \"CB-20\", she was ordered by the Italian \"Regia Marina\" (Royal Navy) for harbour defence and anti-submarine warfare tasks, but she was incomplete at the time of the Italian surrender in September 1943. The unfinished boat was captured by the Germans and completed by March 1944. Her main armament consisted of two external torpedo tubes located on the sides of the hull, and she had a crew of four. Handed over to the navy of the Italian Social Republica World War II German puppet stateshe was captured by Yugoslav ground forces in the port of Pola at the end of the war. Repaired, she was commissioned by the JRM and used to train submariners as well as patrol boat crews in anti-submarine warfare. Following her brief Yugoslav service she was donated to the Technical Museum in Zagreb in 1959 as a museum ship.",

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions.

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

Originally developed as the processor for a telephone switch, it was later used as the basis for a minicomputer and a number of products for their mainframe line. The initial design was a 24-bit processor; that was soon replaced by 32-bit implementations of the same concepts and the original 24-bit 801 was used only into the early 1980s."

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures.",

            "The A-0 system (\"Arithmetic Language version 0\"), written by Grace Murray Hopper in 1951 and 1952 for the UNIVAC I, was an early compiler related tool developed for electronic computers. The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",
            " is a 1999 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation console. It is the eighth main installment in the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Set on an unnamed fantasy world with science fiction elements, the game follows a group of young mercenaries, led by Squall Leonhart, as they are drawn into a conflict sparked by a sorceress named Edea Kramer who seized control of a powerful military state. During the quest to defeat the sorceress and the forces manipulating her, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of his comrades, Rinoa Heartilly."

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program."

The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence. It received a sequel in 1998, \"Skullmonkeys\", which was a platform game, abandoning the adventure format of the original."

The \"Dark Alliance\" series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre."

            "The A-0 system (\"Arithmetic Language version 0\"), written by Grace Murray Hopper in 1951 and 1952 for the UNIVAC I, was an early compiler related tool developed for electronic computers. The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

            "The A-0 system (\"Arithmetic Language version 0\"), written by Grace Murray Hopper in 1951 and 1952 for the UNIVAC I, was an early compiler related tool developed for electronic computers. The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

The Data Encryption Standard's (DES) 56-bit key is no longer considered adequate in the face of modern cryptanalytic techniques and supercomputing power. A CVE released in 2016, \"CVE-2016-2183\" disclosed a major security vulnerability in DES and 3DES encryption algorithms. This CVE, combined with the inadequate key size of DES and 3DES, led to NIST deprecating DES and 3DES for \"new\" applications in 2017, and for \"all\" applications by the end of 2023. It has been replaced with the more secure, more robust AES."

In Indo-European mythology, the thunderbolt was identified with the 'Sky Father'; this association is also found in later Hellenic representations of Zeus and Vedic descriptions of the \"vajra\" wielded by the god Indra. It may have been a symbol of cosmic order, as expressed in the fragment from Heraclitus describing \"the Thunderbolt that steers the course of all things\".",

Jupiter-C is not an architect or architectural firm, but rather a type of American space launch vehicle developed in the mid-20th century. Therefore, it could not have designed a building."

FNSS ACV-30, on the other hand, is a type of armored combat vehicle. These two are in completely different categories, one is ammunition and the other is a vehicle, so it's not possible for FNSS ACV-30 to have designed the .500/465 Nitro Express."

The term 'Avian' typically refers to birds or something relating to birds, and 'Panther' is a type of large cat. In nature, a panther does not design a bird. If 'Avian' and 'Panther' are referring to companies or products, there is no widely known information that suggests a company or product named 'Panther' designs something named 'Avian'. Therefore, based on the information given, the statement is likely true."
