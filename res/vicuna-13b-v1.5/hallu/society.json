            "The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the height of the civil rights movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the voting rights protected by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act sought to secure the right to vote for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country. It is also \"one of the most far-reaching pieces of civil rights legislation in U.S. history.\""

Bush and Al Gore. On December 8, the Florida Supreme Court had ordered a statewide recount of all undervotes, over 61,000 ballots that the vote tabulation machines had missed. The Bush campaign immediately asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the decision and halt the recount. Justice Antonin Scalia, convinced that all the manual recounts being performed in Florida's counties were illegitimate, urged his colleagues to grant the stay immediately. On December 9, the five conservative justices on the Court granted the stay, with Scalia citing \"irreparable harm\" that could befall Bush, as the recounts would cast \"a needless and unjustified cloud\" over Bush's legitimacy. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that \"counting every legally cast vote cannot constitute irreparable harm.\" Oral arguments were scheduled for December 11.",

They are considered significant events in the country's political history and are therefore likely to be well-known within Portugal and among those interested in Portuguese history.\n    Additionally, Portugal is a country located in Europe, while the 1864 Portuguese legislative election and 1865 Portuguese legislative election are specific events that occurred within that country. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is true and the answer is Yes."

It is a -story wood-frame structure, built in 1904 but altered significantly later. Originally Queen Anne in style, the house has irregular massing and a complex cross-gabled roof line. Its original Queen Anne porch was replaced c. 1920 by an American Craftsman style porch with heavy wooden columns set on concrete and brick piers. A later shed-roof porch wraps around the southern side of the building, and at the rear of the house a 1/2 story was added at a later date. The house is notable as the home of United States Congressman Otis Theodore Wingo, and his wife Effiegene Locke Wingo, who served out his final term after his death and then was elected to Congress in her own right."

The former is an election that took place in Illinois, while the latter is a school located in Godfrey, Illinois. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they came from the same country.\n\n    Explanation:\n    The question asks whether it is true that the 1885 United States Senate election in Illinois and Monticello Seminary came from two different countries. To answer this question, we need to determine whether these two entities are related to each other in any way.\n\n    The 1885 United States Senate election in Illinois was a political event that took place in Illinois, a state in the United States. On the other hand, Monticello Seminary is a school located in Godfrey, Illinois. There is no indication that these two entities are related to each other in any way.\n\n    Therefore, we can conclude that it is highly unlikely that the 1885 United States Senate election in Illinois and Monticello Seminary came from two different countries.

Though there were several discussed sites for the creation of the library, the Hillsborough County Commissioners narrowed down their selection to two locations. One of the locations was across the street from Lithia Springs Elementary School on Lithia Pinecrest Road, while the other locality was next to Bloomingdale High School on Bloomingdale Avenue. Though there were concerns regarding possible traffic congestion on Bloomingdale Avenue, the Commissioners ultimately decided to accept the latter option.

Bellamy, the circulation manager for \"The Youth's Companion\" magazine, helped persuade then-president Benjamin Harrison to institute Columbus Day as a national holiday and lobbied Congress for a national school celebration of the day. The magazine sent leaflets containing part of Bellamy's Pledge of Allegiance to schools across the country and on October 21, 1892, over 10,000 children recited the verse together."

Though there were several discussed sites for the creation of the library, the Hillsborough County Commissioners narrowed down their selection to two locations. One of the locations was across the street from Lithia Springs Elementary School on Lithia Pinecrest Road, while the other locality was next to Bloomingdale High School on Bloomingdale Avenue. Though there were concerns regarding possible traffic congestion on Bloomingdale Avenue, the Commissioners ultimately decided to accept the latter option.

Its second session was January 11 through March 24, 2016. The 153rd Georgia General Assembly succeeded the 152nd of 2013 and 2014, and preceded the 154th in 2017 and 2018.",
            "The Internal Security Act of 1950, (Public Law 81-831), also known as the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, the McCarran Act after its principal sponsor Sen. Pat McCarran (D-Nevada), or the Concentration Camp Law, is a United States federal law. Congress enacted it over President Harry Truman's veto. It required Communist organizations to register with the federal government. The 1965 U.S Supreme Court ruling in \"Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board\" saw much of the act's Communist registration requirement abolished. The emergency detention provision was repealed when the Non-Detention Act of 1971 was signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The act's Subversive Activities Control Board, which enforced the law's provision calling for investigations of persons engaging in \"subversive activities,\" would also be abolished in 1972."

The act was completed on March 3, 1980, was signed by President Jimmy Carter on March 17, 1980, and became effective on April 1, 1980. This was the first comprehensive amendment of U.S. general immigration laws designed to face up to the realities of modern refugee situations by stating a clear-cut national policy and providing a flexible mechanism to meet the rapidly shifting developments of today's world policy. The main objectives of the act were to create a new, American definition of refugee based on the one created at the 1951 UN Convention and 1967 Protocol on the Status of Refugees; raise the limitation from 17,400 to 50,000 refugees admitted each fiscal year; provide emergency procedures for when that number exceeds 50,000; require annual consultation between Congress and the President on refugee admissions; and establish the Office of U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs and the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Most importantly, it established explicit procedures on how to deal with refugees in the U.S. by creating a uniform and effective resettlement and absorption policy."

Both are from different countries.\n\n    Explanation:\n    The question asks whether it is true that 131st Ohio General Assembly and Barron High School came from two different countries. To answer this question, we need to determine whether each of these entities is from a different country.\n\n    131st Ohio General Assembly: The 131st Ohio General Assembly is a political body that represents the state of Ohio in the United States. Since Ohio is a state in the United States, the 131st Ohio General Assembly is not from a different country.\n\n    Barron High School: Barron High School is a school located in Barron, Wisconsin, United States. Since Barron is a city in Wisconsin, United States, Barron High School is not from a different country.\n\n    Therefore, the answer is Yes, because both the 131st Ohio General Assembly and Barron High School are not from different countries."

It is an anti-immigration party, advocating significant cuts to legal immigration and protection of French identity, as well as stricter control of illegal immigration. It also advocates for a 'more balanced' and 'independent' French foreign policy by opposing French military intervention in Africa and by distancing France from the American sphere of influence by leaving NATO's integrated command. It supports reform of the European Union (EU) and its related organisations. It also supports economic interventionism and protectionism, and zero tolerance of breaches of law and order.

            "The Spartacus League () was a Marxist revolutionary movement organized in Germany during World War I. It was founded in August 1914 as the International Group by Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, Clara Zetkin, and other members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) who were dissatisfied with the party's official policies in support of the war. In 1916 it renamed itself the Spartacus Group and in 1917 joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), which had split off from the SPD as its left wing faction. During the November Revolution of 1918 that broke out across Germany at the end of the war, the Spartacus Group re-established itself as a nationwide, non-party organization called the \"Spartacus League\" with the goal of instituting a soviet republic that would include all of Germany. It became part of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) when it was formed on 1 January 1919 and at that point ceased to exist as a separate entity."

Following the success of ASEAN's series of post-ministerial conferences launched in the mid-1980s, APEC started in 1989, in response to the growing interdependence of Asia-Pacific economies and the advent of regional trade blocs in other parts of the world; it aimed to establish new markets for agricultural products and raw materials beyond Europe. Headquartered in Singapore, APEC is recognized as one of the highest-level multilateral blocs and oldest forums in the Asia-Pacific region, and exerts significant global influence."

It is the largest parliamentary opposition group in the National Assembly and the party has seen its candidate reach the second round in the 2002, 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. It is an anti-immigration party, advocating significant cuts to legal immigration and protection of French identity, as well as stricter control of illegal immigration. It also advocates for a 'more balanced' and 'independent' French foreign policy by opposing French military intervention in Africa and by distancing France from the American sphere of influence by leaving NATO's integrated command. It supports reform of the European Union (EU) and its related organisations. It also supports economic interventionism and protectionism, and zero tolerance of breaches of law and order. The party has been accused of promoting xenophobia and antisemitism."

Headquartered in Singapore, APEC is recognized as one of the highest-level multilateral blocs and oldest forums in the Asia-Pacific region, and exerts significant global influence."

The SGP is the oldest political party in the Netherlands existing in its present form, and has been in opposition for its entire existence. Since 1925, it has won between 1.6% and 2.5% of the votes in general elections. Owing to its orthodox political ideals and its traditional role in the opposition, the party has been called a testimonial party. Since the general election of 2012, it has held 3 of the 150 seats of the House of Representatives.",

However, in some countries, AIESEC members have been involved in political activities and have even run for political office. For example, in the Netherlands, AIESEC members have been involved in the Reformed Political Party, which is a Christian democratic political party. Therefore, it can be said that AIESEC is a member of the Reformed Political Party in the Netherlands. However, it is important to note that AIESEC's involvement in politics varies from country to country and is not a universal characteristic of the organization."

            "The National Rally (, ; RN), until 2018 known as the National Front (, ; FN), is a far-right political party in France. It is the largest parliamentary opposition group in the National Assembly and the party has seen its candidate reach the second round in the 2002, 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. It is an anti-immigration party, advocating significant cuts to legal immigration and protection of French identity, as well as stricter control of illegal immigration. It also advocates for a 'more balanced' and 'independent' French foreign policy by opposing French military intervention in Africa and by distancing France from the American sphere of influence by leaving NATO's integrated command. It supports reform of the European Union (EU) and its related organisations. It also supports economic interventionism and protectionism, and zero tolerance of breaches of law and order. The party has been accused of promoting xenophobia and antisemitism.",

The term \"Reformed\" is not a reference to political reform but is a synonym for Calvinism—a major branch of Protestantism. The SGP is the oldest political party in the Netherlands existing in its present form, and has been in opposition for its entire existence. Since 1925, it has won between 1.6% and 2.5% of the votes in general elections. Owing to its orthodox political ideals and its traditional role in the opposition, the party has been called a testimonial party. Since the general election of 2012, it has held 3 of the 150 seats of the House of Representatives."

The party is described as \"big tent\", practising \"brokerage politics\", attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters. The Liberal Party is the longest-serving and oldest active federal political party in the country, and has dominated federal politics of Canada for much of its history, holding power for almost 70 years of the 20th century.

AIESEC is a global youth-led organization that aims to develop leadership and entrepreneurial skills in young people. The European Youth Forum is an umbrella organization that represents the interests of youth organizations in Europe. It is a member of the European People's Party, which is a political party in the European Union. The European People's Party Group is a political group in the European Parliament that includes several member parties, including the Sweden Democrats.\n\n    Therefore, we can conclude that AIESEC is not a direct member of the Sweden Democrats. However, AIESEC is a member of the European Youth Forum, which is a member of the European People's Party, which is a member of the European People's Party Group, which includes the Sweden Democrats as one of its member parties. Hence, we can say that AIESEC is indirectly associated with the Sweden Democrats through their membership in the European People's Party Group."

This means that Aetna has a relationship with the university and may have some involvement in its activities.

It is the largest parliamentary opposition group in the National Assembly and the party has seen its candidate reach the second round in the 2002, 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. It is an anti-immigration party, advocating significant cuts to legal immigration and protection of French identity, as well as stricter control of illegal immigration. It also advocates for a 'more balanced' and 'independent' French foreign policy by opposing French military intervention in Africa and by distancing France from the American sphere of influence by leaving NATO's integrated command. It supports reform of the European Union (EU) and its related organisations. It also supports economic interventionism and protectionism, and zero tolerance of breaches of law and order. The party has been accused of promoting xenophobia and antisemitism.",

This indicates that ADMIE is, in fact, a subsidiary of Telenor.\n\n    Therefore, we can conclude that the statement 'Is it true that ADMIE is a member of Telenor?' is true. The answer is Yes."

FC Schwandorf is a member of the University of Waterloo. To answer this question, we need to check if there is any evidence that supports this claim.\n\n    After searching the web, we found that 1. FC Schwandorf is a football club based in Germany. On the other hand, the University of Waterloo is a public research university located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\n\n    Since there is no evidence to suggest that 1. FC Schwandorf is a member of the University of Waterloo, we can conclude that the statement is false. Therefore, the answer is No."
