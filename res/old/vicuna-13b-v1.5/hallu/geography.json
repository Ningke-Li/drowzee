Check if Torrecilla de Valmadrid is a settlement.\n    2. Check if Gállego is a settlement.\n    3. Check if Torrecilla de Valmadrid is near Gállego.\n    \n    Step 1: Check if Torrecilla de Valmadrid is a settlement.\n    We know that Torrecilla de Valmadrid is a municipality located in the province of Madrid, Spain. Therefore, we can confirm that Torrecilla de Valmadrid is a settlement.\n    \n    Step 2: Check if Gállego is a settlement.\n    We know that Gállego is a municipality located in the province of Ávila, Spain. Therefore, we can confirm that Gállego is a settlement.\n    \n    Step 3: Check if Torrecilla de Valmadrid is near Gállego.\n    We know that Torrecilla de Valmadrid is located in the province of Madrid, and Gállego is located in the province of Ávila. These two provinces are not adjacent, and there is no clear definition of what it means for a settlement to be \"near\" another settlement in this context. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether Torrecilla de Valmadrid is near Gállego or not.\n    \n    Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that the statement is true, as Torrecilla de Valmadrid is not a settlement near Gállego."

The municipality was established in 1841 following the municipal reforms of the 1840s, ranking as a parish municipality (sognekommune) until 1950 when suburbanisation of Copenhagen inhabited the municipality and the status was changed to town municipality (købstadskommune). From 1947 to 1960 the population in the municipality doubled due to the expanding suburbs of Copenhagen, reaching the municipality in the post-war period. Glostrup was designated as a new suburb along the western Tåstrup-finger of the Copenhagen Finger Plan of 1947."

In this case, Anápolis shares borders with both Goianápolis and Pirenópolis, and since Goianápolis shares borders with Pirenópolis, we can conclude that Anápolis shares borders with Pirenópolis. Therefore, we can say that Goianápolis has a relation with Pirenópolis through their borders through Anápolis."

Since Chudčice shares borders with Rozdrojovice through Brno, and Rozdrojovice shares borders with place\\_c, it follows that Chudčice shares borders with place\\_c indirectly as well. Therefore, the statement is true according to their borders through Brno."

It more immediately flows into the east-south channel around the Flevopolder, Flevoland which is kept at 3 metres below sea level. This body of water is then pumped up into the IJsselmeer."

The western terminus is at an interchange with US Highway 31 (US 31) and Business US 31 (Bus. US 31) on the eastern boundary of Norton Shores southeast of Muskegon, and the eastern terminus is at I-75 near the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. From Grand Rapids through Lansing to Detroit, the freeway parallels Grand River Avenue, never straying more than a few miles from the decommissioned US 16. The Wayne County section of I-96 is named the Jeffries Freeway from its eastern terminus to the junction with I-275 and M-14. Though maps still refer to the freeway as the Jeffries, the portion within the city of Detroit was renamed by the state legislature as the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway in December 2005 in honor of the late civil rights pioneer. There are four auxiliary Interstates as well as two current and four former business routes associated with I-96."

The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Soviet Union, which marked the beginning of the end of the Axis powers' dominance in World War II. The battle also had significant strategic and symbolic importance, as it prevented the Axis powers from gaining control of the southern part of the Soviet Union and marked a major setback for Nazi Germany's military ambitions. Therefore, the Battle of Stalingrad can be considered a major turning point in World War II."

The President also has the power to grant pardons to prisoners. However, the President does not have the power to declare war or approve the federal budget, as these powers are held by the Federal Assembly. Additionally, the President does not have the power to resolve disputes between federal subjects, as this power is held by the Constitutional Court."

Therefore, it is true that Virginia is not associated with Chesapeake Bay in the sense that it is not a part of the bay itself.\n\n    However, it is worth noting that Virginia is one of the states that borders Chesapeake Bay, and there are many places within Virginia that are associated with the bay, such as the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, which connects Virginia's Eastern Shore to the mainland.\n\n    Therefore, while the statement \"Virginia is not associated with Chesapeake\" is technically true, it is a bit misleading, as there are many places within Virginia that are associated with Chesapeake Bay."

However, resolving conflicts between provinces is not one of its responsibilities. While the federal government can play a role in mediating disputes between provinces, the provinces themselves have the primary responsibility for managing their own internal affairs.

Therefore, it is likely that the canton of Carcassonne-3 is far away from Carcassonne."

        "llm_answer": "\n    Answer:\n    Yes, because West Ukrainian People's Republic is a historical entity that existed in the past and is not currently in existence. Therefore, it is not possible for it to be far away from Lviv or close to it.\n\n    Reasoning process:\n    To determine whether the statement \"West Ukrainian People's Republic is far away from Lviv\" is true or false, we need to consider the following:\n    \n    1. The location of the West Ukrainian People's Republic in relation to Lviv.\n    2. The current existence of the West Ukrainian People's Republic.\n    3. The meaning of the word \"far away\" in the context of the statement.\n\n    1. The West Ukrainian People's Republic was a historical entity that existed in the past, specifically during the Ukrainian War of Independence in 1917-1921. It was located in the western part of Ukraine, which is now part of Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Therefore, it is not possible for it to be located in the same city or region as Lviv, which is located in western Ukraine.\n    2. The West Ukrainian People's Republic is not currently in existence. It was a short-lived state that was dissolved after the Ukrainian War of Independence. Therefore, it is not possible for it to be far away from or close to Lviv.\n    3. The word \"far away\" is subjective and can vary depending on the context and the perspective of the person making the statement. However, in the context of the statement, it is reasonable to assume that \"far away\" means a significant distance or a long way from Lviv.\n\n    Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that the statement \"West Ukrainian People's Republic is far away from Lviv\" is true."

It largely supplants the old US Route 21 (US 21) between Cleveland, Ohio, and Columbia, South Carolina, as an important north–south corridor through the middle Appalachian Mountains. The southern terminus of I-77 is in Cayce, South Carolina, in Lexington County at the junction with I-26. The northern terminus is in Cleveland at the junction with I-90. Other major cities that I-77 connects to include Columbia, South Carolina; Charlotte, North Carolina; Charleston, West Virginia; and Akron, Ohio. The East River Mountain Tunnel, connecting Virginia and West Virginia, is one of only two instances in the US where a mountain road tunnel crosses a state line. The other is the Cumberland Gap Tunnel, connecting Tennessee and Kentucky. I-77 is a snowbird route to the Southern US for those traveling from the Great Lakes region."

The original motte and bailey castle was built in the late 11th century by Norman invaders on top of a 3rd-century Roman fort. The castle was commissioned either by William the Conqueror or by Robert Fitzhamon, and formed the heart of the medieval town of Cardiff and the Marcher Lord territory of Glamorgan. In the 12th century the castle began to be rebuilt in stone, probably by Robert of Gloucester, with a shell keep and substantial defensive walls being erected. Further work was conducted by the 6th Earl of Gloucester in the second half of the 13th century. Cardiff Castle was repeatedly involved in the conflicts between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh, being attacked several times in the 12th century, and stormed in 1404 during the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr."
