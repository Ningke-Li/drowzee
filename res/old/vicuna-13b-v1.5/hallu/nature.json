Cruithne does not orbit Earth and at times it is on the other side of the Sun, placing Cruithne well outside of Earth's Hill sphere. Its orbit takes it near the orbit of Mercury and outside the orbit of Mars. Cruithne orbits the Sun in about one Earth year, but it takes 770 years for the series to complete a horseshoe-shaped movement around Earth.",

It is estimated to be 5 meters in diameter, which means that it poses no threat if it impacts Earth. An impact would have the kinetic energy of about 3 kt of TNT, and would probably result in an air burst in the upper atmosphere. It is the least threatening asteroid listed on the Sentry Risk Table.

To determine this, we need to consider the evidence available for both objects.\n\n    'KOI\\_1430' is a transiting exoplanet candidate, which means it is a planet-like object that passes in front of its host star, causing a measurable decrease in the star's brightness. This suggests that 'KOI\\_1430' is a large object with a relatively small size compared to its host star, and that it orbits closely around the star.\n\n    '2002\\_NT7' is a known Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), which is a type of icy body that orbits the Sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. It has been suggested that '2002\\_NT7' is the parent body of 'KOI\\_1430' based on the similarity in their orbits and the presence of debris in the same region of space. Specifically, the orbits of 'KOI\\_1430' and '2002\\_NT7' are similar in terms of their semi-major axes and their inclinations, and there is evidence of a debris field in the same region of space as 'KOI\\_1430'.\n\n    Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that '2002\\_NT7' is the parent astronomical body of 'KOI\\_1430'.

To answer this question, we need to check if there is any evidence in the data that supports or refutes this statement.\n\nIn the data, we can see that there is a row for 2014\\_RC and a row for 617\\_Patroclus. The \"parent\\_body\" column in the data indicates the parent body of each asteroid. For 617\\_Patroclus, the value in the \"parent\\_body\" column is \"2014\\_RC\". Therefore, we can conclude that the statement is true, and the answer is \"Yes\"."

To answer this question, we need to determine if 2 Pallas and 3 Juno are from different groups.\n\n    2 Pallas is from the Pallas group, which is a group of asteroids named after the asteroid 2 Pallas. The Pallas group is also known as the Pallas family or the Pallasian asteroids.\n\n    3 Juno is from the Juno group, which is a group of asteroids named after the asteroid 3 Juno. The Juno group is also known as the Juno family or the Junoian asteroids.\n\n    Since 2 Pallas is from the Pallas group and 3 Juno is from the Juno group, we can conclude that they are from different groups.

To answer this question, we need to know the definition of minor planet groups. A minor planet group is a collection of minor planets that have similar orbits and compositions.\n\n    2060 Chiron is a centaur, which is a minor planet that orbits between Jupiter and Neptune. Centaurs have orbits that are unstable and can be influenced by the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Neptune, causing them to have highly eccentric orbits.\n\n    On the other hand, 4179 Toutatis is an asteroid that orbits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids are minor planets that have orbits within the asteroid belt, which is a region of the solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\n\n    Since 2060 Chiron and 4179 Toutatis have different orbits, they are from different minor planet groups. Therefore, the answer to the question is Yes."

            " is an Apollo asteroid and a near-Earth object that has a 1 in 4 billion chance of impacting Earth on 7 March 2113. It is estimated to be 5 meters in diameter, which means that it poses no threat if it impacts Earth. An impact would have the kinetic energy of about 3 kt of TNT, and would probably result in an air burst in the upper atmosphere. It is the least threatening asteroid listed on the Sentry Risk Table. The very short observation arc of only 3 hours results in a very poorly constrained orbit, and it could just as easily be 2 AU from Earth on 7 March 2113."
