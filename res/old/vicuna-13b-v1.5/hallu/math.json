The theorem is often cited in discussions of voting theory as it is further interpreted by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem. The theorem is named after economist and Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, who demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book \"Social Choice and Individual Values\".

This equation has a vast and important application in determining the rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula. Currently, it is best seen as an empirical relationship. It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processes/reactions. The Eyring equation, developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy."

The statement says that taw did not give name to Atbash. To prove this, we need to show that there is no direct relationship between the two names.\n\n    One way to do this is to examine the etymology of the two names. Taw is the 19th letter in the Arabic alphabet, and Atbash is the 19th letter in the Hebrew alphabet. This suggests that the two names may be related to the number 19, rather than to each other.\n\n    Another way to prove this is to show that the two names are used for different purposes. Taw is used in the Arabic language, while Atbash is used in the Hebrew language. This suggests that the two names are not directly related, but rather are used in different contexts.\n\n    Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that the statement is true, and that taw did not give name to Atbash."

The paradox had already been discovered independently in 1899 by the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo. However, Zermelo did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other academics at the University of Göttingen. At the end of the 1890s, Georg Cantor – considered the founder of modern set theory – had already realized that his theory would lead to a contradiction, as he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter."
