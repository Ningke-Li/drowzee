            "Arrow's impossibility theorem, the general possibility theorem or Arrow's paradox is an impossibility theorem in social choice theory that states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting the specified set of criteria: \"unrestricted domain\", \"non-dictatorship\", \"Pareto efficiency\", and \"independence of irrelevant alternatives\". The theorem is often cited in discussions of voting theory as it is further interpreted by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem. The theorem is named after economist and Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, who demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book \"Social Choice and Individual Values\". The original paper was titled \"A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare\"."

The scenario involves an indirect observation of a quantum measurement: An observer formula_1 observes another observer formula_2 who performs a quantum measurement on a physical system. The two observers then formulate a statement about the physical system's state after the measurement according to the laws of quantum theory. However, in the \"orthodox\" Copenhagen interpretation, the resulting statements of the two observers contradict each other. This reflects a seeming incompatibility of two laws in the Copenhagen interpretation: the deterministic and continuous time evolution of the state of a closed system and the nondeterministic, discontinuous collapse of the state of a system upon measurement. Wigner's friend is therefore directly linked to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics with its famous Schrödinger's cat paradox."

The Hopf construction is a mathematical concept that was introduced by the mathematician Hassler Whitney in the early 20th century, and it is not associated with Heinz Hopf. While Heinz Hopf was a prominent mathematician who made significant contributions to various areas of mathematics, including algebraic topology, he did not have any direct involvement in the development of the Hopf construction.

        "llm_answer": " Sure! Here is my answer to the question \"Andrey Markov named Markov chain\":\n\nNo, because Andrey Markov did not name Markov chains.\n\nThe concept of a Markov chain was first introduced by French mathematician Émile Borel in his 1909 paper \"Applications des probabilités à la théorie des nombres et des fonctions\". Borel defined a Markov chain as a sequence of random variables where each variable is independent of its predecessors and has a fixed probability distribution.\n\nAndrey Markov, on the other hand, made significant contributions to the field of stochastic processes, including the development of the Markov chain model. However, he did not coin the term \"Markov chain\" himself. Instead, it was later adopted as a common reference to these types of processes in honor of Markov's work."

The theorem establishes Shannon's channel capacity for such a communication link, a bound on the maximum amount of error-free information per time unit that can be transmitted with a specified bandwidth in the presence of the noise interference, assuming that the signal power is bounded, and that the Gaussian noise process is characterized by a known power or power spectral density.
