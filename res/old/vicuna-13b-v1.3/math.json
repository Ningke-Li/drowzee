            "In physical chemistry, the Arrhenius equation is a formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates. The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff who had noted in 1884 that the van 't Hoff equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. This equation has a vast and important application in determining the rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula. Currently, it is best seen as an empirical relationship. It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processes/reactions. The Eyring equation, developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy."

The theorem establishes Shannon's channel capacity for such a communication link, a bound on the maximum amount of error-free information per time unit that can be transmitted with a specified bandwidth in the presence of the noise interference, assuming that the signal power is bounded, and that the Gaussian noise process is characterized by a known power or power spectral density.

            "Arrow's impossibility theorem, the general possibility theorem or Arrow's paradox is an impossibility theorem in social choice theory that states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting the specified set of criteria: \"unrestricted domain\", \"non-dictatorship\", \"Pareto efficiency\", and \"independence of irrelevant alternatives\". The theorem is often cited in discussions of voting theory as it is further interpreted by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem. The theorem is named after economist and Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, who demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book \"Social Choice and Individual Values\". The original paper was titled \"A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare\"."

The scenario involves an indirect observation of a quantum measurement: An observer formula_1 observes another observer formula_2 who performs a quantum measurement on a physical system. The two observers then formulate a statement about the physical system's state after the measurement according to the laws of quantum theory. However, in the \"orthodox\" Copenhagen interpretation, the resulting statements of the two observers contradict each other. This reflects a seeming incompatibility of two laws in the Copenhagen interpretation: the deterministic and continuous time evolution of the state of a closed system and the nondeterministic, discontinuous collapse of the state of a system upon measurement.

            "In the mathematical discipline of general topology, Stone–Čech compactification (or Čech–Stone compactification) is a technique for constructing a universal map from a topological space \"X\" to a compact Hausdorff space \"βX\". The Stone–Čech compactification \"βX\" of a topological space \"X\" is the largest, most general compact Hausdorff space \"generated\" by \"X\", in the sense that any continuous map from \"X\" to a compact Hausdorff space factors through \"βX\" (in a unique way). If \"X\" is a Tychonoff space then the map from \"X\" to its image in \"βX\" is a homeomorphism, so \"X\" can be thought of as a (dense) subspace of \"βX\"; every other compact Hausdorff space that densely contains \"X\" is a quotient of \"βX\". For general topological spaces \"X\", the map from \"X\" to \"βX\" need not be injective."

It was first created by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd in 1934. Independently from Reutersvärd, the triangle was devised and popularized in the 1950s by psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son, prominent Nobel Prize-winning mathematician Sir Roger Penrose, who described it as \"impossibility in its purest form\". It is featured prominently in the works of artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it."

The theorem establishes Shannon's channel capacity for such a communication link, a bound on the maximum amount of error-free information per time unit that can be transmitted with a specified bandwidth in the presence of the noise interference, assuming that the signal power is bounded, and that the Gaussian noise process is characterized by a known power or power spectral density.

He is known for his work on mathematical logic and the development of symbolic logic. De Morgan's laws are named after him because he was the first to formulate them in their modern form. Therefore, it is true that Augustus De Morgan named De Morgan's laws.\n        No, because De Morgan's laws were actually named after a person named William De Morgan, who was a potter and a writer. Augustus De Morgan had nothing to do with the naming of De Morgan's laws. Therefore, it is false that Augustus De Morgan named De Morgan's laws."

            "The Penrose triangle, also known as the Penrose tribar, the impossible tribar, or the impossible triangle, is a triangular impossible object, an optical illusion consisting of an object which can be depicted in a perspective drawing, but cannot exist as a solid object. It was first created by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd in 1934. Independently from Reutersvärd, the triangle was devised and popularized in the 1950s by psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son, prominent Nobel Prize-winning mathematician Sir Roger Penrose, who described it as \"impossibility in its purest form\". It is featured prominently in the works of artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it."

This relationship was discovered by David Hilbert, who proved the Nullstellensatz in his second major paper on invariant theory in 1893 (following his seminal 1890 paper in which he proved Hilbert's basis theorem)."
