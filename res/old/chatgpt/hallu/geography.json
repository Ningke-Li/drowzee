In this case, Monale is place_a, Asti is place_b, and Portacomaro is place_c. Since Monale shares borders with Asti and Asti shares borders with Portacomaro, it can be concluded that Monale indirectly shares borders with Portacomaro.

In this case, Vigliano d'Asti is place_a, Cossombrato is place_c, and Asti is place_b. Since Vigliano d'Asti does not directly share borders with Cossombrato and Asti is the only common border between them, there is no indirect border connection between Vigliano d'Asti and Cossombrato. Therefore, Vigliano d'Asti has no relation with Cossombrato according to their borders through Asti."

            "Baccarat or baccara (; ) is a card game played at casinos. It is a comparing card game played between two hands, the \"player\" and the \"banker\". Each baccarat coup (round of play) has three possible outcomes: \"player\" (player has the higher score), \"banker\", and \"tie\". There are three popular variants of the game: \"punto banco\", \"baccarat chemin de fer\", and \"baccarat banque\" (or \"à deux tableaux\"). In \"punto banco\", each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt. In \"baccarat chemin de fer\" and \"baccarat banque\", by contrast, both players can make choices. The winning odds are in favour of the bank, with a house edge of at least 1 percent."

            "Baccarat or baccara (; ) is a card game played at casinos. It is a comparing card game played between two hands, the \"player\" and the \"banker\". Each baccarat coup (round of play) has three possible outcomes: \"player\" (player has the higher score), \"banker\", and \"tie\". There are three popular variants of the game: \"punto banco\", \"baccarat chemin de fer\", and \"baccarat banque\" (or \"à deux tableaux\"). In \"punto banco\", each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt. In \"baccarat chemin de fer\" and \"baccarat banque\", by contrast, both players can make choices. The winning odds are in favour of the bank, with a house edge of at least 1 percent."

A 2006 population estimate by the now-closed German population site called World Gazetteer put the population at 100,541, which would make it the fifth largest city in Lebanon, according to the 2006 population estimates of Lebanese cities, but after an update in either 2007 or 2008 and calculations for the following years the 2013 population estimate turned out to be much lower at 36,593 and making the city the 11th largest in Lebanon behind Tyre, Bint Jbeil, Zahlé, Sidon, Baalbek, Jounieh, Tripoli and Beirut according to those 2013 estimates. It is the main city in the Jabal Amel area and the chief center for both the mohafazat, or governorate, and the kaza, or canton both also called Nabatieh.

            "The Moulton Courthouse Square Historic District is a historic district in Moulton, Alabama. Moulton's development began in 1820, when it was chosen as the county seat of the newly formed Lawrence County. The first courthouse was a log structure; a log jail on the west side of the square operated until 1911, when it was replaced with the current, 3-story brick jail and courthouse annex. Due to its lack of rail and river connections, development around the square remained sparse. The log courthouse was replaced in 1860 with a two-story, square building with Classical Revival details. The cotton economy of Lawrence County rebounded after the Civil War with the construction of several cotton gins, though nearly all of the structures built along the square in the late 19th century were later razed and replaced. The oldest extant buildings in the district were built in 1911: the three-story courthouse annex, and the two-story, stone faced Citizens' Bank building. The northern part of Market Street, on the west side of the square, were constructed during the early 1920s. Lawrence County's economy received a boost from New Deal programs, most notably the Tennessee Valley Authority's fertilizer program and construction of Wheeler Dam. Most of the square's buildings were constructed during the late 1930s and 1940s, in contrast to most historic downtowns around the South. The current courthouse was completed in 1936. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998."

The city became the trade center of the region but the population grew relatively slowly. Only after 1960 did the population start to grow from around 10,000 to around 80,000 by the 2010s. From the 1960s onwards, Purmerend has seen major expansion and continues to do so. This expansion has turned Purmerend into a commuter town; many inhabitants of Purmerend (14,200 in 2011) work, go to school or spend their leisure time in Amsterdam. Purmerend is part of the Randstad, one of the largest conurbations in Europe.",

The Beemster polder was drained between 1609 and 1612. It has preserved intact its well-ordered landscape of fields, roads, canals, dykes and settlements, laid out in accordance with classical and Renaissance planning principles. A grid of canals parallels the grid of roads in the Beemster. The grids are offset: the larger feeder canals are offset by approximately one kilometer from the larger roads."
