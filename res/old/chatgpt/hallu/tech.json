The player has access to security cameras throughout the restaurant to monitor animatronic activity.

Laid down in 1943 by the Caproni company in Milan as \"CB-20\", she was ordered by the Italian \"Regia Marina\" (Royal Navy) for harbour defence and anti-submarine warfare tasks, but she was incomplete at the time of the Italian surrender in September 1943. The unfinished boat was captured by the Germans and completed by March 1944. Her main armament consisted of two external torpedo tubes located on the sides of the hull, and she had a crew of four. Handed over to the navy of the Italian Social Republica World War II German puppet stateshe was captured by Yugoslav ground forces in the port of Pola at the end of the war. Repaired, she was commissioned by the JRM and used to train submariners as well as patrol boat crews in anti-submarine warfare. Following her brief Yugoslav service she was donated to the Technical Museum in Zagreb in 1959 as a museum ship."

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code.

The unfinished boat was captured by the Germans and completed by March 1944. Her main armament consisted of two external torpedo tubes located on the sides of the hull, and she had a crew of four. Handed over to the navy of the Italian Social Republica World War II German puppet stateshe was captured by Yugoslav ground forces in the port of Pola at the end of the war. Repaired, she was commissioned by the JRM and used to train submariners as well as patrol boat crews in anti-submarine warfare. Following her brief Yugoslav service she was donated to the Technical Museum in Zagreb in 1959 as a museum ship."

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs.

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."

The Data Encryption Standard's (DES) 56-bit key is no longer considered adequate in the face of modern cryptanalytic techniques and supercomputing power. A CVE released in 2016, \"CVE-2016-2183\" disclosed a major security vulnerability in DES and 3DES encryption algorithms. This CVE, combined with the inadequate key size of DES and 3DES, led to NIST deprecating DES and 3DES for \"new\" applications in 2017, and for \"all\" applications by the end of 2023. It has been replaced with the more secure, more robust AES."

Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure.

The Data Encryption Standard's (DES) 56-bit key is no longer considered adequate in the face of modern cryptanalytic techniques and supercomputing power. A CVE released in 2016, \"CVE-2016-2183\" disclosed a major security vulnerability in DES and 3DES encryption algorithms. This CVE, combined with the inadequate key size of DES and 3DES, led to NIST deprecating DES and 3DES for \"new\" applications in 2017, and for \"all\" applications by the end of 2023.

While primarily associated with the Soviet Union, it has been used by many countries since the 1970s. It is chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge, which replaced the 7.62×39mm cartridge of Kalashnikov's earlier automatic weapons for the Soviet armed forces.",
            "Mališan (pennant number: P-901) was a CB-class midget submarine that served in the Yugoslav Navy (; JRM) from 1953 to 1957. Laid down in 1943 by the Caproni company in Milan as \"CB-20\", she was ordered by the Italian \"Regia Marina\" (Royal Navy) for harbour defence and anti-submarine warfare tasks, but she was incomplete at the time of the Italian surrender in September 1943. The unfinished boat was captured by the Germans and completed by March 1944. Her main armament consisted of two external torpedo tubes located on the sides of the hull, and she had a crew of four. Handed over to the navy of the Italian Social Republica World War II German puppet stateshe was captured by Yugoslav ground forces in the port of Pola at the end of the war. Repaired, she was commissioned by the JRM and used to train submariners as well as patrol boat crews in anti-submarine warfare. Following her brief Yugoslav service she was donated to the Technical Museum in Zagreb in 1959 as a museum ship."

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures.",

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

During the quest to defeat the sorceress and the forces manipulating her, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of his comrades, Rinoa Heartilly."

            "Baldur's Gate is a series of role-playing video games set in the Forgotten Realms \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" campaign setting. The game has spawned two series, known as the \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" and the \"Dark Alliance\", both taking place mostly within the Western Heartlands, but the Bhaalspawn Saga extends to Amn and Tethyr. The \"Dark Alliance\" series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.",
            " is a fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Square in 1988 for the Family Computer as the second installment of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game has received numerous enhanced remakes for the WonderSwan Color, the PlayStation, the Game Boy Advance, the PlayStation Portable, iOS, Android and Windows. As neither this game nor \"Final Fantasy III\" were initially released outside Japan, \"Final Fantasy IV\" was originally released in North America as \"Final Fantasy II\", so as not to confuse players. Following enhanced versions for iOS and Android in 2010 and 2012 respectively, the game was re-released again as part of the 2021 \"Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster\" series."
