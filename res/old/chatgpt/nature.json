Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an S-type asteroid, the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt. On 28 August 1993, Ida was visited by the uncrewed \"Galileo\" spacecraft while en route to Jupiter.

It was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at Vienna Observatory and named after a nymph from Greek mythology. Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an S-type asteroid, the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt. On 28 August 1993, Ida was visited by the uncrewed \"Galileo\" spacecraft while en route to Jupiter. It was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite.",

In ancient Egypt, the Season of the Harvest, also known as the Season of Emergence, was the time when the Nile floodwaters receded, leaving behind fertile soil for planting crops. This was followed by the Season of the Inundation, which was the flooding period when the Nile River overflowed its banks, providing water and nutrients for the crops to grow. Therefore, the Season of the Inundation is directly preceded by the Season of the Harvest."

As of 1 October 2017, it had a small Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of . On 12 October 2017, it passed Earth at . The asteroid was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 16 October 2017 and with a 5-year observation arc has a well-known orbit. For example, on the previously risk-listed date of 12 October 2022, it is now known that the asteroid will be more than from Earth.",
            " is an Apollo asteroid and a near-Earth object that has a 1 in 4 billion chance of impacting Earth on 7 March 2113. It is estimated to be 5 meters in diameter, which means that it poses no threat if it impacts Earth. An impact would have the kinetic energy of about 3 kt of TNT, and would probably result in an air burst in the upper atmosphere. It is the least threatening asteroid listed on the Sentry Risk Table. The very short observation arc of only 3 hours results in a very poorly constrained orbit, and it could just as easily be 2 AU from Earth on 7 March 2113."

The Season of the Inundation is characterized by heavy rainfall and flooding, which provides the necessary water for crops to grow. Once the flooding recedes, the Season of the Emergence begins, during which plants emerge from the ground and start to grow. Therefore, it is generally true that the Season of the Emergence is preceded by the Season of the Inundation."

It is not round but is shaped like an ellipsoid of approximately 380×330×250 km. It was discovered on 4 February 1858, by Hermann Goldschmidt from his balcony in Paris. It is named after Europa, one of Zeus's conquests in Greek mythology, a name it shares with Jupiter's moon Europa."

It was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at Vienna Observatory and named after a nymph from Greek mythology. Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an S-type asteroid, the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt. On 28 August 1993, Ida was visited by the uncrewed \"Galileo\" spacecraft while en route to Jupiter. It was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite.",

Therefore, they belong to different minor planet groups."
