            "Dead or Alive 5 Last Round is a 2015 fighting game developed by Team Ninja and published by Koei Tecmo for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Arcades, and Windows. It is the third and final updated version of 2012's \"Dead or Alive 5\", following 2013's \"Dead or Alive 5 Plus\" and \"Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate\". Notable changes from \"Ultimate\" include two additional characters and a graphical upgrade for the new generation of consoles. Unlike the original \"Dead or Alive 5\", as a download update for PS3 and Xbox 360, the game can convert either the digital versions of \"5 Ultimate\" or \"5 Ultimate: Core Fighters\" into \"5 Last Round\". Like \"5 Ultimate\", a free-to-play version titled Dead or Alive 5 Last Round: Core Fighters, was released alongside the retail game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows.",

The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. \"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced innovations that became staples of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent \"Final Fantasy\" games, and unlike prior games in the series, \"IV\" gave each character their own unchangeable character class.",

On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature."

It is based on the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail \"in which French militiamen hurl a heifer onto a band of English relic seekers\", and to further tie-in to the movie, \"funny quotes from the movie appear in bubbles over the characters\".",

Set in a fictional pizzeria, the player takes on the role of night security guard Jeremy Fitzgerald, who must defend themselves from the restaurant's hostile animatronic mascots while in their office. The player has access to security cameras throughout the restaurant to monitor animatronic activity. Wearing an animatronic mask allows the player to avoid being detected in most cases, though some animatronics are repelled through other methods. If an animatronic enters the office and the player is detected, they will be killed. As the game progresses, Atari-styled minigames and phone calls provide insight on the history of the restaurant.",

The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence. It received a sequel in 1998, \"Skullmonkeys\", which was a platform game, abandoning the adventure format of the original.",

He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. \"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced innovations that became staples of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and role-playing games in general.

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program."

The unfinished boat was captured by the Germans and completed by March 1944. Her main armament consisted of two external torpedo tubes located on the sides of the hull, and she had a crew of four. Handed over to the navy of the Italian Social Republica World War II German puppet stateshe was captured by Yugoslav ground forces in the port of Pola at the end of the war. Repaired, she was commissioned by the JRM and used to train submariners as well as patrol boat crews in anti-submarine warfare. Following her brief Yugoslav service she was donated to the Technical Museum in Zagreb in 1959 as a museum ship."

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

Released in 1991, it is the fourth main installment of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. \"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced innovations that became staples of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent \"Final Fantasy\" games, and unlike prior games in the series, \"IV\" gave each character their own unchangeable character class."

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions.

It may have been a symbol of cosmic order, as expressed in the fragment from Heraclitus describing \"the Thunderbolt that steers the course of all things\".",

The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence.

The \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.",

The Data Encryption Standard's (DES) 56-bit key is no longer considered adequate in the face of modern cryptanalytic techniques and supercomputing power. A CVE released in 2016, \"CVE-2016-2183\" disclosed a major security vulnerability in DES and 3DES encryption algorithms. This CVE, combined with the inadequate key size of DES and 3DES, led to NIST deprecating DES and 3DES for \"new\" applications in 2017, and for \"all\" applications by the end of 2023. It has been replaced with the more secure, more robust AES."

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

            "Lightning is a natural phenomenon formed by electrostatic discharges through the atmosphere between two electrically charged regions, either both in the atmosphere or with one in the atmosphere and on the ground, temporarily neutralizing these in a near-instantaneous release of an average of one gigajoule of energy. This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit.",

Sunsoft re-released it in North America during 1998; Square followed with a Japan-exclusive remake released for the WonderSwan Color and mobile phones in 2002 and 2007 respectively, it was also ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2020 and later ported to Android, iOS and Microsoft Windows in 2021."

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code.

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."

Originally developed as the processor for a telephone switch, it was later used as the basis for a minicomputer and a number of products for their mainframe line. The initial design was a 24-bit processor; that was soon replaced by 32-bit implementations of the same concepts and the original 24-bit 801 was used only into the early 1980s.",

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure.

            "Millipedes (from Latin , meaning \"wood louse\", which in turn is from Latin , \"thousand\", and , \"foot\") are a group of arthropods that are characterised by having two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments; they are known scientifically as the class Diplopoda, the name derived from this feature. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

A CVE released in 2016, \"CVE-2016-2183\" disclosed a major security vulnerability in DES and 3DES encryption algorithms. This CVE, combined with the inadequate key size of DES and 3DES, led to NIST deprecating DES and 3DES for \"new\" applications in 2017, and for \"all\" applications by the end of 2023.

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program."

The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

In North America, the game was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called \"Power Pellets\" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points."

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."

The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. \"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced innovations that became staples of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent \"Final Fantasy\" games, and unlike prior games in the series, \"IV\" gave each character their own unchangeable character class."

The \"Dark Alliance\" series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.",

The 370 was connected to the 305 by a serial data line from the \"S track\" of the computer's drum memory (the printer and punch both obtain information from a single output track, the control as to what information to print or punch and how, is within the print and punch units) and printed 80-columns with a punched tape controlled carriage. Line formatting was programmed by inserting wire jumpers into a plugboard control panel."

            "Lightning is a natural phenomenon formed by electrostatic discharges through the atmosphere between two electrically charged regions, either both in the atmosphere or with one in the atmosphere and on the ground, temporarily neutralizing these in a near-instantaneous release of an average of one gigajoule of energy. This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.",

Laid down in 1943 by the Caproni company in Milan as \"CB-20\", she was ordered by the Italian \"Regia Marina\" (Royal Navy) for harbour defence and anti-submarine warfare tasks, but she was incomplete at the time of the Italian surrender in September 1943. The unfinished boat was captured by the Germans and completed by March 1944. Her main armament consisted of two external torpedo tubes located on the sides of the hull, and she had a crew of four. Handed over to the navy of the Italian Social Republica World War II German puppet stateshe was captured by Yugoslav ground forces in the port of Pola at the end of the war. Repaired, she was commissioned by the JRM and used to train submariners as well as patrol boat crews in anti-submarine warfare.

On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.",

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures.",

            "The Neverhood (released in Japan as Klaymen Klaymen: The Mystery of Neverhood) is a 1996 point-and-click adventure video game developed by The Neverhood, Inc. and published by DreamWorks Interactive for Microsoft Windows. The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence. It received a sequel in 1998, \"Skullmonkeys\", which was a platform game, abandoning the adventure format of the original.",

The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence. It received a sequel in 1998, \"Skullmonkeys\", which was a platform game, abandoning the adventure format of the original."

The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code.

The initial design was a 24-bit processor; that was soon replaced by 32-bit implementations of the same concepts and the original 24-bit 801 was used only into the early 1980s."

This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit."
