It is based on the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail \"in which French militiamen hurl a heifer onto a band of English relic seekers\", and to further tie-in to the movie, \"funny quotes from the movie appear in bubbles over the characters\"."

            " known as \"Final Fantasy II\" for its initial North American release, is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1991, it is the fourth main installment of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. \"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced innovations that became staples of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent \"Final Fantasy\" games, and unlike prior games in the series, \"IV\" gave each character their own unchangeable character class.",

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program."

Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball.

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program."

Originally developed as the processor for a telephone switch, it was later used as the basis for a minicomputer and a number of products for their mainframe line. The initial design was a 24-bit processor; that was soon replaced by 32-bit implementations of the same concepts and the original 24-bit 801 was used only into the early 1980s.",

Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure.

The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that all of its animation was done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets. The gameplay consists mostly of guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance. Video sequences help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, \"The Neverhood\" aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence. It received a sequel in 1998, \"Skullmonkeys\", which was a platform game, abandoning the adventure format of the original."

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into 16 orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures."

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a tight ball. Although the name \"millipede\" derives from Latin for \"thousand feet\", no species was known to have 1,000 or more until the discovery in 2020 of \"Eumillipes persephone\", which can have over 1,300 legs.

Though it was developed by the Turbine team (with Microsoft's extensive assistance), it was published as a Microsoft title until 2004. The game was set on the island continent of Dereth and several surrounding smaller islands and archipelagos on the fictional planet of Auberean.

The Data Encryption Standard's (DES) 56-bit key is no longer considered adequate in the face of modern cryptanalytic techniques and supercomputing power. A CVE released in 2016, \"CVE-2016-2183\" disclosed a major security vulnerability in DES and 3DES encryption algorithms. This CVE, combined with the inadequate key size of DES and 3DES, led to NIST deprecating DES and 3DES for \"new\" applications in 2017, and for \"all\" applications by the end of 2023. It has been replaced with the more secure, more robust AES."

Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure.
